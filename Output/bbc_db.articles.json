    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy\n\nThe Hong Kong government has suspended its highly controversial plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced.\n\nShe had previously refused to scrap the bill despite mass protests from Hong Kong residents.\n\n\"I feel deep sorrow and regret that deficiencies in our work – and various other factors – have stirred up substantial controversies,\" she said.\n\nProtesters expressed concern at increased Chinese influence.\n\nMs Lam said she had heard the calls for her government to \"pause and think\".\n\nShe also admitted that the \"explanation and communication\" of the bill had not been adequate.\n\nShe said her goal was \"the greatest interests of Hong Kong\", which involved first restoring peace and order.\n\nThe government had argued the proposed extradition bill would \"plug the loopholes\" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan.\n\nMs Lam said that the urgency felt to pass the bill before the legislative year ends \"perhaps no longer exists\".\n\nNo date has been set for \"the next step forward\", she said.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the plans\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have protested against the bill and further demonstrations were planned for Sunday.\n\nCritics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence.\n\nProtest leaders said that despite Ms Lam's announcement, they would continue their demonstrations until the bill was cancelled, not just delayed.\n\n'Striking U-turn'\n\nAnalysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong\n\nIt was a striking U-turn from a leader who previously struck a defiant tone.\n\nMere days ago, Ms Lam had vowed to press ahead with the unpopular legislation – now she has promised to \"listen to different views from society\".\n\nBut for many protesters, the damage has already been done, and the move to delay - but not cancel - the legislation is unlikely to assuage their concerns.\n\nOne protester told me he believed the government was \"trying to divert attention away until opposition calms down - and then they'll try to re-do the whole process again\".\n\nOthers said they would still take part in a march against the proposal planned for Sunday.\n\n\"Our final goal is to cancel the law, not to pause it. I think there will still be many people coming out tomorrow,\" a student leader told me.\n\nHong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy.\n\nChina's foreign ministry publicly backed Ms Lam after her announcement.\n\n\"The Chinese Central Government expresses its support, respect and understanding for the [Hong Kong] government's decision,\" spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement.\n\nAmid the international debate on Hong Kong, he also warned that its \"affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no interference from any country, organization or individual\".\n\nWhat was the controversy about?\n\nThe changes would allow for criminal extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau - decided on a case-by-case basis by Hong Kong courts.\n\nIt comes after a high-profile case where a Hong Kong man was accused of murdering his girlfriend on holiday in Taiwan but could not be extradited.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests\n\nHong Kong officials, including Ms Lam, say the bill is necessary to protect the city against criminals.\n\nBut many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state.\n\nOpposition activists also cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China.\n\nHow did protests unfold?\n\nA large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday.\n\nThen on Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill.\n\nTensions boiled over and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested.\n\nThe police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets, have been accused of excessive force by some rights groups.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police use tear gas on protesters\n\nUntil Saturday's announcement, Ms Lam had not spoken publicly since she labelled the protests \"organised riots\" during a tearful address.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Helier Cheung on why people are taking to the streets in Hong Kong\n\nIs Hong Kong part of China?\n\nHong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War - which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China. It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997.\n\nIt is now part of China under a \"one country, two systems\" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system.\n\nIt is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region.\n\nBut it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs.\n\nWhy are people angry about the plan?\n\nPeople in Hong Kong are worried that the extradition bill could bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control.\n\nHong Kong officials had said its courts would have the final say whether to grant extradition requests.\n\nMs Lam's government had also said suspects accused of political and religious crimes would not be extradited, insisting legally binding human rights safeguards would also be in place.",

    "article" : "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption To break into the Soviet Union, Pepsi swapped its soft drink for vodka and even warships\n\nBartering is one of the oldest ways of doing business in the world.\n\nThe exchange of goods and services predates the use of money and is believed to have developed in the first human societies. Today, bartering is usually associated with countries in turmoil.\n\nTake fisherman in Venezuela who now swap their catch for other food stuffs or medicines, because after years of hyperinflation the country's currency is now nearly worthless.\n\nOr the bartering networks that emerged in Greece at the height of its financial crisis eight or so years ago.\n\nHowever, it is not just individuals who continue to engage in bartering, it is also used by governments. And again, this is often the case when a country is facing financial woes and isolation on the world stage, such as Venezuela or Iran.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Iran has been swapping its oil for Indian rice - a key foodstuff for Iranians\n\nFor both countries bartering has enabled them to get around US-led economic blockades.\n\nBartering also continues to occasionally be used by companies, such as Indonesian aircraft maker Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) agreeing to trade two of its transport aircraft for 110,000 tonnes of Thai sticky rice back in 1996. That was all the Thai buyer had to offer.\n\nAnd in an even more eye-opening historic example, back in the 1970s US giant Pepsi traded its soft drink for Soviet tomato paste, so it could enter the USSR market. Pepsi, which owned Pizza Hut at the time, spread the tomato paste across its pizzas in western Europe. It also bartered its fizzy drink for Russian vodka, and even Soviet warships, which it sold on for scrap.\n\nSwedish chart-toppers Abba did something similar in the Soviet Union, where they earned royalties in the form of fruit, vegetables and crude oil, which were then sold on the global market.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Venezuela and Cuba's close ties were put in place by Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro\n\nBack in Iran, it has used bartering to support its economy ever since the US first imposed sanctions after the Iranian revolution of 1979. The Iranians then had to start bartering even more when tough curbs were imposed by the United Nations between 2010 and 2015.\n\nWith the UN sanctions making it impossible for Iran to buy goods on the international markets with its own currency, Tehran started offering crude oil, and gold held in vaults abroad, in exchange for basic staples like rice, cooking oil and tea.\n\nAfter the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, the UK, the US - as well as Germany and the European Union, Iran was able to start trading normally again.\n\nBut last year President Trump pulled the US out of the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and re-imposed sanctions. This has forced Iran to return to bartering, such as reviving its old agreement with India, whereby it exchanges its oil for rice.\n\nUsing a method that is bit more complicated than a straight swap, Iran agrees to accept payment for its oil in Indian rupees. The money is paid into an Indian bank account operated by an Indian state-owned bank.\n\nIran then uses this to pay for rice and other Indian imports such as pharmaceuticals, with no money crossing banks or borders. It's a moot point whether this bartering violates sanctions or not, but until the US removed special waivers for Iran's main oil importers, it had become a common way to do business.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Venezuela swaps oil for Cuban workers\n\nFrance, Germany and the UK set up a similar scheme earlier this year to allow companies in their countries to trade with Iran. The initiative is called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchange, and it is limited to humanitarian goods, such as medicines and food items.\n\nIn Venezuela, it is not just goods that are bartered - it can be workers too. It sends 50,000 barrels of oil every day to Cuba. In return Cuba sends its highly trained doctors, teachers and economic advisors to work in Venezuela.\n\nMost barter deals are struck when conventional avenues are blocked. says Michael Czinkota, an associate professor of international business at Georgetown University in Washington.\n\nHe says this is also the case for other trade deals that are not straight cash payments, which are known collectively as \"countertrades\". These can include a simple mix of barter and money, to pledges of future investment or purchases.\n\n\"The starting point for countertrades is always that something is wrong with the traditional system,\" he says. \"The companies I talk to who do countertrade say if they could do everything they do for money that would always be their first preference.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Iran's Hassan Rouhani (left) and India's Narendra Modi (right) maintain close ties\n\nMeanwhile, Shirley Mustafa, an economist at the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation, says such deals became more common after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"Some countries lost confidence in the international trading system [so they took action],\" she says.\n\nTrading goods for other goods or services also helps governments to save precious foreign currency reserves. For this reason some countries actively seek barter or other countertrade deals, says Lindsey Shanson, editor of Countertrade and Offset magazine.\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nOne such nation is Malaysia, which back in the 1990s swapped some of its abundant palm oil crop for Russian fighter aircraft. Earlier this year, it proposed doing the same thing again as it wants to modernise its defence forces, but has little spare cash.\n\nRegarding the decision of Indonesian aircraft mater IPTN to accept Thai sticky rice as payment, economist Travis Taylor says the company simply wanted to get a deal done.\n\nImage caption Abba were sellers of crude oil\n\n\"In that case it was really about building reputational capital [in a new market],\" says Mr Taylor, who is an associate professor of economics at Christopher Newport University in Virginia.\n\n\"No-one wants to be stuck with tonnes of sticky rice. But this company also wanted evidence that the aircraft could be sold. So they couldn't be picky.\"\n\nProf Taylor adds that a specific type of countertrade deal called \"offset agreements\" continue to be prevalent in the global defence sector. Under these agreements defence firms agree to generate economic activity within a country over a period of time, such as buying or making components there.\n\nOverall, he says that bartering and the other types of countertrade are here to stay, \"particularly among developing countries and during times of instability\".",

    "article" : "Image copyright National Oceanography Centre Image caption The Boaty McBoatface autonomous underwater vehicle is designed to run on low power\n\nFrom arctic wastes to fiery volcanoes, ocean depths to distant planets, a new generation of rugged drones is going to places humans can't. But how do you make a super-tough drone?\n\nWhen it sets off on its arctic explorations, the Royal Research Ship (RSS) David Attenborough will be carrying within it a full complement of autonomous flying and submersible vehicles designed to lay bare the mysteries of the polar regions.\n\nOne underwater drone or AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) that may be aboard come launch day bears the name Boaty McBoatface, the quirky moniker chosen for its mother ship in an online poll which was subsequently overruled.\n\nBoaty is designed to dive to 6,000m (19,700 ft) where the pressure is about 600 times greater than at sea level. Less rugged vehicles would be crushed completely at those depths.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Attenborough launches 'Boaty McBoatface' polar ship\n\nIt comes equipped with a payload of sensors, imaging equipment, sonar, hydrophones and communications kit to gather data on changing deep ocean temperatures and their potential impact on climate change.\n\nOne of the toughest challenges its National Oceanography Centre designers faced was being able to build a craft that could travel long distances under the ice without needing to recharge.\n\nRecent advances in microprocessors, much of it driven by smartphone technology, has helped change that by reducing the amount of power these drones need to run.\n\n\"The vehicle is designed to draw a very small amount of power for its propulsion systems,\" explains Dr Maaten Furlong, head of marine autonomous and robotics systems at the National Oceanography Centre.\n\n\"As a result it travels at a relatively slow speed, which in turn enables it to cover huge distances and carry out extended missions compared to vehicles that have gone before.\"\n\nEarly last year, Boaty - or the Autosub Long Range (ALR) to give it its proper name - completed its first full under-ice expedition at the Filchner Ice Shelf in West Antarctica, where it spent a total of 51 hours under the Antarctic ice, travelling 108km (67 miles).\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nIt reached depths of 944m, at one time travelling under a section of ice shelf 550m thick. GPS signals can't penetrate so far down, so navigation is tricky.\n\nInstead, it has to use dead reckoning. By using a point of origin - such as the mother ship - it estimates the direction and distance travelled, calculating speed by bouncing sound off the seabed and measuring the echoes.\n\nIts fibre-optic gyro-based sensor has an error rate of 0.1%, which means for every kilometre travelled it could drift one metre off course, the designers say.\n\nBut to explore even further and deeper, new navigation tech will be required. And this is under development.\n\nCalled Terrain Aided Navigation, this system essentially maps the sea floor, and these maps are loaded in to the vehicle's computer. Ultimately, the designers hope the robots will be able to \"see\" well enough to create their own maps in real time.\n\n\"A long-term ambition for the ALR family of vehicles is to deliver on the potential and the ambition to complete a full trans-Arctic mission under ice, an environment about which we know very little at this point.\n\n\"This will require the new Terrain Aided Navigation techniques being developed to be fully operational.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Nasa's Lemur robot can climb vertical cliffs\n\nArctic sub-sea conditions are pretty tough, but the surface of planet Mars is even tougher, bringing with it a whole new set of design challenges.\n\nTwo devices being developed by Nasa to survey the volcanic bowels of the red planet are currently being trialled on Earth, with their designers envisaging uses much closer to home.\n\nLemur - short for Limbed Excursion Mechanical Utility Robot - is a four-limbed machine that can scale rock walls, gripping with hundreds of tiny hooks in each of its 16 fingers. Engineers from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Labs took Lemur on a field test in California's Death Valley in January, where it used artificial intelligence to choose a route up a cliff.\n\nNasa's Dr Aaron Parness says Lemur's rock-climbing abilities could be used for search and rescue operations to help disaster relief teams.\n\nFinding claws that wouldn't wear down on the rock was a challenge.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lava rock can be very abrasive and difficult to traverse for humans... and robots\n\n\"We looked at titanium, steel, carbon fibre, carbide, tool steel,\" says Dr Parness. \"We tried sewing needles to sail boat needles, syringes, lathe tools, even harvesting cactus spines.\"\n\nThe winning solution? Fishing hooks.\n\n\"Turns out that industry is really good at making things sharp, strong, and durable,\" he says.\n\nNasa's other tough robot is Volcanobot, a relatively low-cost device designed to be lowered in to fissures and survive extreme heat.\n\nOn a trial mission to the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii, it mapped the conduits of previous eruptions to get an understanding of how that style of volcano works underground.\n\nBut building machines that can navigate over harsh terrain as well as deal with extreme temperatures has proven tough.\n\nVolcanic rock \"is extremely sharp and hard,\" explains Dr Parness. \"If you walk a mile of two across a lava flow, the soles of your shoes will be 100% trashed.\"\n\nSo Volcanotbot uses carbon-fibre infused material in its 3D-printed parts to make them stronger and more resistant to abrasion.\n\n\"It gets scratched up like crazy, but protects the electronics inside,\" he says.\n\nWhile the team has created casings and materials that can withstand 300C, the weak link is the electronics inside, which \"tend to fail around 60-80C\".\n\n\"It didn't help to have a strong robot shell protecting dead robot guts!\"\n\nImage copyright Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Image caption These Japanese firefighting robots are designed to deflect extreme heat\n\nMitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan has developed a team of automated firefighting robots designed to cope with extreme heat.\n\nEquipped with GPS and laser sensors to help them navigate to the scene of the fire, a water cannon robot takes up a position then the hose extension drone drives to the water source, laying out hose along the ground.\n\nThe water cannon can then unleash its payload, squirting up to 4,000 litres per minute.\n\nThe system was put through its first trial in March at Tokyo's National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster, with its designers envisaging their use in highly volatile environments such as petro-chemical blazes.\n\nA spokesman for the design team said the aim is for the robots to fully-autonomous in time.\n\nRobotics expert Prof Barry Lennox says that reduced construction costs, better materials and improved sensors are driving the development of tough drones around the world.\n\n\"Over the next five to 10 years I would expect to see even more complex environments being explored,\" he says.",

It's shark-infested water. The challenge is to get across, unharmed.\n\n\"I'm a building machine, I can build anything,\" says Oliver after he tells everyone about the Lego mechanism he has designed.\n\nHe has built a speedboat with not one, but three \"distracter blasters\".\n\nOne will launch fish at the sharks, the second is a net which will capture the sharks too busy feasting to notice and finally - as they sail safely past - a special serum will destroy the net and release the sharks back into the wild.\n\nImage caption Amy, Jordan and Oliver sit and listen to Caryn's instructions\n\nThis is the first time Amy, Jordan and Oliver have been on board the Block Bus and to them it seems like a play centre on wheels.\n\nContainers full of different types of building blocks tower above them. Cuddly toys are placed on the sofa and Jordan grabs a monkey which he nestles next to him. Sensory lights create a calm mood - this is a safe and inviting space.\n\nThe children get comfortable on the mat. Caryn's instruction is to build a tower.\n\n\"Same instruction, different models. We all think a little bit differently and that's OK,\" Caryn says, as all three get to work and create something completely different.\n\nThe organisation which runs the Block Bus, Alpha Inclusion, uses Lego therapy and building blocks to help children between the ages of five and 16 improve their social communication, interaction and personal effectiveness. They provide small group sessions as well as working with individuals.\n\nOriginally an American invention, Lego therapy was created to help children with autism and learning difficulties to develop their communication skills, but it is now used more widely.\n\nThe Block Bus travels about and can park up to create an accessible environment for all.\n\nCurrently covering East Anglia, Alpha Inclusion works with about a dozen schools regularly, and has worked with many more to train staff to work with children. The Block Bus also visits local events and festivals.\n\nFounder Amy Eleftheriades has worked in this field for more than 20 years.\n\n\"Over the years I have found that Lego can be tricky for some children and they need to start on a more basic level,\" she says.\n\n\"Some children can't necessarily manipulate the Lego and so we find out their interests, and use that to engage with them. We might use arts, clay or play. It depends on the child.\"\n\nAlpha Inclusion has been working with St Michael's voluntarily aided junior school for more than a year. They work closely to understand the needs of the individual child, and train teaching assistants to enable them to reproduce the work they do.\n\n\"Underlying everything we do is children's mental health and wellbeing,\" says Mrs Helen McCarney, who has been head teacher at the school for 15 years. \"If you cannot tackle that they cannot learn.\"\n\nLego therapy is an accessible mechanism for intervention and it isn't used just for autism.\n\nMrs McCarney explains that activities with Lego help the children open up and talk about their problems. These interventions also help some children engage with the wider curriculum.\n\nAlpha Inclusion also works with children who are close to exclusion, re-engaging them and improving their home-school relationships.\n\n\"It's really powerful,\" says Mrs Kath Brabbin, the school's Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO).\n\n\"We had a girl last year who was refused by another school, but with the help of Amy and Caryn she is now in school and attending lessons.\"\n\nImage caption Mrs Brabbin and Head Teacher Mrs McCarney\n\n\"We work with the needs rather than the label,\" Amy says. \"People believe in us, and it's meant that they have gone above and beyond.\"\n\nThe Block Bus doesn't just help children. Amy and her team also use it for corporate work including team-building activities, wellbeing sessions, communication skills, development training and autism awareness.\n\nProfits generated are reinvested to assist in delivering services for education, health and social care.\n\nBack in the bus Caryn asks the children to build something with four pieces and then pass it on. Oliver places his four pieces down and passes it to Jordan. He watches on, but seems concerned to see the structure change.\n\nCaryn notices and asks: \"Are you OK Oliver, you seem a bit upset by how Jordan has changed the barn?\" Oliver takes a moment to think before he replies: \"I'm OK with it because we are all putting our ideas together.\"\n\n\"Sometimes children don't like to go out of class, and be seen to be different. So if you can say to them 'we are going to go and do something with Lego', it feels like play. It's not like doing work,\" says Mrs Brabbin.\n\n\"It's like a lesson outside. The children turn around and say 'we didn't have class today'.\"\n\nFor Amy this is just the beginning.\n\n\"This is our first year and we are still learning,\" she says. \"But in my head we have a whole fleet of double-decker buses.\"\n\nWritten by Maria Nicola with photographs by Phil Coomes.",

But I suddenly saw a big, warm dot in [the] far distance—it was Upernavik.\n\n\"The beauty of this tranquil village was really beyond my imagination.

    "article" : "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption All those emails you don't have time to deal with could be making you ill\n\nAndrew Crosby has 7,000 emails in his inbox. To some that might not sound like many, but he's only been at Relax Gaming for a year, so there's not been much time for the inbox to get out of control.\n\nAs a senior executive at the software company, which has eight offices around Europe, he fields around 140 emails a day.\n\n\"You have to pick and choose what you think is going to be relevant to yourself... you can get cc'ed into so many emails that are nothing to do with yourself whatsoever,\" he says.\n\nAnd there's the key problem with email. The message that might contain the single most important thing you need to know all year, could well disappear into the landfill that is your inbox.\n\nEmail malaise\n\nIt's not just inefficient, it's also bad for your health.\n\nImage caption Many of our inboxes are crowded with emails we will probably never read again\n\n\"Email overload is causing people to get ill,\" says Cary Cooper, organisational psychology professor at Manchester University.\n\nHis research has found that higher email load is associated with higher workload stress.\n\n\"The problem is there aren't good guidelines on what is the best use of email and the things we should not do,\" he says.\n\n\"We cc in everybody rather than just the one or two people we should be interacting with. Line managers should never send emails outside of office hours to their subordinates unless it's absolutely essential.\n\n\"There's no point in sending someone an email on a Friday night saying you don't have to deal with this until Monday, because people will then worry about it and do it that weekend.\"\n\nBut he is not saying that email should be eliminated altogether.\n\n\"It's a great way to keep in touch with people, particularly who are remote. It's a great way to send data, to send information. By itself it's fine - it's the way people are using it is the problem,\" says Prof Cooper.\n\nEnforced breaks\n\nFrance has tried to improve the situation. In 2017, a law was introduced that obliged firms to come up with a plan to ensure staff get a break from office emails. In August 2018, the French arm of Britain's Rentokil Initial was ruled to have broken that law and was ordered to pay an employee €60,000 (£53,000).\n\nNo such rules exist here in the UK, but some firms have taken action anyway.\n\nPlatypus Digital is a marketing agency which runs fundraising campaigns for charities. From the very start, in 2014, its founders banned internal emails and any staff who forget have to donate £5 to charity.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption One solution is \"inbox zero\" - rigorously dealing with all emails as they come in each day\n\n\"We'd all worked in charities and companies that had been around a lot longer and experienced that internal email overload, where the majority of your day is trawling through internal updates that you don't need to be a part of,\" says managing director Matt Collins.\n\nInstead, the company's seven employees use a messaging service and documents software from Google, and a project management system from Asana.\n\n\"We decided to use tools that were much more effective and much more fun,\" Mr Collins adds.\n\nInbox zero\n\nBut what if you work in a much larger organisation, where you have to use email to get anything done?\n\nClare Godson is a senior lawyer and executive director at global legal subscription business Aosphere. Six months ago she decided to try \"inbox zero\" and has been \"evangelical\" about it ever since. The idea is to manage your inbox strictly, ideally not having anything there at all.\n\nImage copyright Clare Godson Image caption Lawyer Clare Godson is evangelical about achieving 'inbox zero'\n\nThere's lots of advice about how to do it on the internet, but broadly you have to do something with every email you receive.\n\n\"It's completely revolutionised the way I feel about my email,\" she says. \"I never have that feeling any more that there's something lurking in there that I've forgotten to deal with.\n\n\"It's massively satisfying as a way of working, it just makes me feel more efficient and I think I feel lighter mentally.\"\n\nShe accepts that for many people it's a big hurdle.\n\n\"Most people are incredulous that you could possibly get there. They think you must be constantly in your inbox checking, deleting and sorting, which isn't true.\"\n\nPeople also think she can't be that busy, which she also rejects: \"The busier you are, the more you need to be rigorous and organised.\"\n\nSlack attack\n\nLet's face it, for most office workers, inbox zero is never going to happen.\n\nWhoever who can solve this communication problem \"will be the most important software company in the world\". That's according to Slack, a US company which sells a service that allows staff to message each other and co-operate on projects.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Slack hopes to become 'the most important software company in the world'\n\nIts founders, frustrated with email, launched Slack in 2014 and, according to the firm, more than 600,000 organisations use the service.\n\nOn Slack, communications are based on groups of users rather than individual inboxes. Despite losing $420m in three years, it plans to list on the stock market later this month.\n\nAndrew Crosby of Relax Gaming uses Slack and likes it, although it has not stopped him accumulating 7,000 emails in his inbox.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nOther firms are also trying to exploit frustration with emails, including Microsoft, which Slack identifies as its biggest rival. Microsoft Teams was launched in 2017 and the company says that more than 500,000 firms use the service.\n\nFacebook also offers a collaboration tool called Workplace.\n\nThe secret?\n\nWhile many people rave about such services, they don't appear to be a complete replacement for email. It is still the best way to communicate with people outside your organisation.\n\nThe trick, according to Mr Collins, is to be strict about how you use it. He attaches a document to all his emails explaining his personal policy, which warns correspondents that his emails will be brief and, unless they are a current client, they should not expect a quick reply.\n\nHe says lots of people read his personal policy and like it. And it seems to be working. When I speak to him he has just 20 emails in his inbox. If all this seems a bit too much effort, then perhaps you should consider inbox infinity.\n\nThe idea is to let the emails pile up, embrace the chaos and thus liberate yourself from the guilt and anxiety. Just make sure you don't miss the message from the boss about your pay rise.",

    "article" : "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aarey forest is in Mumbai city\n\nThe Aarey forest, a verdant strip that lies at the heart of India's bustling Mumbai city, is often referred to as its last green lung. But now, locals say, it's under threat from encroachment. BBC Marathi's Janhavee Moole reports.\n\nAs a child, Stalin Dayanand used to picnic in the Aarey forest.\n\n\"It was the only place where you could go and play, climb trees or just sit and eat under the shade of a tree and be close to nature,\" says Stalin, who prefers to go by his first name.\n\nNow the 54-year-old is the director of an NGO that works to protect forests and wetlands. He is fighting for Aarey.\n\nOn 6 June, the government cleared 40 hectares (99 acres) of the 1,300 hectare forest to build a zoo, complete with a night safari.\n\nAnother slice of it is being claimed by Mumbai's new metro rail which is currently under construction. Thousands of trees will have to be felled to construct a new multi-level parking unit for the metro.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What happens if you ban plastic?\n\nStalin has petitioned India's Supreme Court challenging the construction, but the case is still pending.\n\nLocals and environmental activists like him are up in arms because they fear the government will eventually clear the way for private builders to encroach on the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which lies to the north of Aarey. Spread over 104 sq km (40 sq miles), this protected area makes Mumbai one of the rare cities to have a jungle within its boundaries.\n\nTheir concern is partly fuelled by the fact that this is prime location in a city where land is scarce and real estate prices are among the most expensive in the world.\n\nBut officials dismiss these fears as unfounded and point out that the construction for the metro only requires 30 hectares of the 1,300 hectares that make up the Aarey forest.\n\n\"This is the most suitable land due to its size, shape and location,\" says Ashwini Bhide, managing director of the Mumbai metro rail corporation.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Plans to fell trees in the forest have led to protests\n\nShe adds that the city badly needs a \"mass rapid transport system\". India's financial hub is congested and infamous for its crawling traffic jams and its local train system heavily overburdened.\n\nOfficials say that the metro will eventually carry around 1.7 million passengers every day and bring down the number of vehicles on the road by up to 650,000. The city's current colonial-era railway system, which is effectively its lifeline, ferries some 7.5 million people between Mumbai's suburbs and its heart on a daily basis.\n\nBut they have been up against the city's residents, including activists and conservationists, ever since news emerged in 2014 that trees would be cut to make way for the metro.\n\nRead more India stories\n\nWhat makes the issue complicated is that the Aarey forest is the site of competing claims.\n\nIt's locally known as the Aarey \"milk colony\" because most of the land was given to the department of dairy development in 1951. But they are allowed to grow cattle fodder only on a fraction of the land. The rest of it is densely forested and dotted with lakes, and the Mithi river flows through it.\n\nAarey is also home to tribal communities who live in settlements known as \"padas\".\n\n\"We are not getting basic facilities here, and now metro authorities want to take away the jungle which belongs to us too,\" says Asha Bhoye, who belongs to the Konkani tribe and lives in one of the 29 padas. Plans to relocate some of the tribal communities have also met with resistance and led to protests.\n\nStalin alleges that instead of declaring the Aarey forest a protected area, the state government has used the opportunity to parcel away pieces of it first to the dairy development department and now to other projects.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Tribals who live in Aarey demand that it be declared a protected area\n\n\"Aarey Forest is part of the same forest as Sanjay Gandhi National Park and we are fighting for the national park itself. In the name of public good, the land is being opened up for developers. It's a systematic effort to destroy the forest.\"\n\nActivists fear that after the parking units are built, other projects will be permitted, further threatening the area's ecology and wildlife, which includes leopards.\n\nSo locals have joined the fight enthusiastically, even leading hikes into the forest to raise awareness. \"We bring people here, make them familiar with the forest - there are many species of spiders like trapdoor spiders, the site [of the parking unit] is a leopard site,\" says Yash Marwa, a screenwriter who is among those campaigning for the forest.\n\n\"Mumbai needs to be liveable\", he adds. \"We need to talk about good quality of air and life before talking about infrastructure and development.\"\n\nStalin agrees, saying that \"air quality and temperature seem to be last among people's priorities.\"\n\nBut he is determined to not give up.\n\n\"If I couldn't do something for my city I'd consider I've failed myself.\"",

    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kris Daly and Claire Cole say genome sequencing was \"priceless\" in helping identify Millie-Mae's rare form of epilepsy\n\nGenome sequencing is set to revolutionise the diagnosis of rare childhood conditions, according to researchers in Cambridge.\n\nAll seriously ill children in England with an unexplained disorder will be eligible for genome analysis, which involves mapping a person's entire genetic code, from next year.\n\nIt follows a project at Addenbrooke's Hospital and Cambridge university.\n\nOne in four children in intensive care had a genetic disorder, it found.\n\nResearchers were able to give a diagnosis within two to three weeks, which sometimes led to a change in treatment or spared children further invasive tests.\n\nIn each case, the whole genome of the child and both their parents were sequenced, which showed whether a gene fault had been passed on.\n\n'Fast meaningful result'\n\nSo far, about 350 babies and children in intensive care at Addenbrooke's Hospital have had their genome, made up of billions of letters of DNA code, analysed as part of the Next Generation Children research project.\n\nIn two-thirds of cases, the gene error had occurred spontaneously at conception rather than being inherited.\n\nThe children had a range of conditions - including birth abnormalities, neurological symptoms including epilepsy, metabolic diseases or reduced growth.\n\nLucy Raymond, professor of medical genetics and neurodevelopment at the University of Cambridge, who led the project, said: \"It is astonishing to be able to give a meaningful result from whole genome sequencing analysis in just a couple of weeks, compared to earlier in my career, when we spent years simply trying to locate a single gene.\"\n\nOne surprising finding was that a child's appearance and clinical symptoms alone were rarely a good predictor of whether they had a genetic condition.\n\nImage copyright Picken family Image caption Seren was born with an incredibly rare gene disorder\n\nProf Raymond said the project would be used as a template by the NHS Genomic Medicine Service and rolled out across England in 2020.\n\nThis will mean that any baby or child in England admitted to intensive care with an unexplained condition will be eligible, together with their parents, for whole genome sequencing - the first national health service in the world to offer this.\n\nSo what will it mean for families?\n\nFirst, a more rapid diagnosis. That was the case for Claire Cole and Kris Daly, parents of Millie-Mae, aged two, who has a rare form of epilepsy.\n\nThey were offered whole genome sequencing last year, after Millie-Mae had been repeatedly admitted to hospital with uncontrolled seizures.\n\nClaire told BBC News: \"We were given the result when she was in intensive care, and they immediately changed one of her medications which was aggravating for her type of epilepsy.\n\nImage copyright Fergus Walsh Image caption Millie-Mae and her parents, Claire and Kris, had their genomes sequenced\n\n\"We saw a big difference as soon as that change was made,\" she said.\n\nKris added: \"The test result came amazingly quickly and was priceless, because it allowed us to put all the correct people in place and do the best for her.\"\n\nClaire and Kris, from Suffolk, who have three other older children, were told that Millie-Mae's condition was the result of a spontaneous mutation rather than being passed on from them.\n\nClaire said: \"Millie-Mae has Dravet syndrome, which is a serious condition, so it was a difficult thing to be told, but I'm glad we have a diagnosis now, as not knowing would be very hard.\"\n\nMillie-Mae has a mutation in the SCN1A gene and routine genetic testing would have eventually revealed this.\n\nBut Prof Raymond said this would have taken many more months, and with other conditions it could take years for families to get a diagnosis.\n\nShe said: \"Parents will no longer have to suffer an agonising diagnostic odyssey of going to different specialists repeating their story and we can use that time focused on the care of the child.\"\n\nThe move to whole genome analysis has become possible because of the dramatic increase in the speed of sequencing, and the fall in price.\n\nIt costs less than £1,000 to sequence a genome but Prof Raymond said this could eventually save the NHS money through avoiding repeated diagnostic tests when trying to find the cause of a rare disorder, which could previously take many years.\n\nHow else could whole genome sequencing help families?\n\nIn the case of Katie and Ian Picken, from Essex, it explained why their baby daughter, Seren, died, and gave them certainty that their son, Rhys, was unaffected.\n\nSeren was born in September 2017, apparently healthy, but within a few weeks she began to have seizures and was admitted to intensive care. Her condition deteriorated and she died at 13 weeks.\n\nSeren and her parents had had blood samples taken, which were sent for whole genome sequencing. The samples confirmed that she had a fatal mitochondrial disorder, but its cause could not be pinpointed because no variants were found in any genes known to cause disease.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Katie Picken says genome sequencing helped bring closure after their first baby died, and gave hope for the future\n\nProf Raymond and her team had found two variants in a previously unreported gene, NDUFA6, and that Seren had inherited one from each parent, but the role of the gene was unclear.\n\nIn May 2018, Katie and Ian contacted Addenbrooke's to tell them that she was pregnant, and this prompted an urgent reanalysis of their genomes to establish whether the couple were at risk of passing on a fatal disorder.\n\nUsing GeneMatcher, Prof Raymond uploaded the gene variants on to a global database and found three other children with the same incredibly rare condition, which affects mitochondrial function.\n\nA research paper was published within weeks, recording the first cases of the disorder - which was essential because the NHS can only offer prenatal testing for a gene if it has been published in medical literature.\n\nKatie had chorionic villus sampling at 15 weeks, where a small sample of cells is removed from the placenta.\n\nBoth parents had passed on a faulty copy of the NDUFA6 gene to Seren, so it meant there was a one in four chance they would pass on the fatal disorder to their unborn son.\n\nThere then followed an anxious few days waiting for the results before they got a call from Prof Raymond saying the pregnancy was unaffected.\n\nIan said: \"It was a hugely emotional moment; we sat and cried with happiness, and with sadness because of what we had gone through with Seren.\"\n\nThe couple's son, Rhys, was born in December 2018, a year after the death of his sister, and is completely healthy.\n\n\"Genomics has the potential to transform the delivery of care for patients which is why the NHS has prioritised it in its Long Term Plan,\" said Prof Dame Sue Hill, chief scientific officer of NHS England.\n\n\"This Cambridge trial is important because not only does it show the potential benefits of whole genome sequencing to significantly improve care for seriously ill children, but it also demonstrates this technology can be delivered as part of a mainstream NHS service.\"\n\nFollow Fergus on Twitter.",

    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Missouri farm in floodwaters\n\nFive hundred acres of Blake Hurst's farm in Westboro, Missouri, are under water.\n\n\"In the first round of flooding, we had over 150 acres under water,\" Mr Hurst recalls. \"A lot of it had been planted, so those crops are lost.\"\n\nThat was in March, when the Midwest's first bout of heavy rainstorms coupled with melting snow saw rivers inundate communities. \"It's been one damn thing after another.\"\n\nSince then, America's heartland has had little reprieve from rain. May was the second-wettest month in recorded US history.\n\nIn addition to rain, the thunderstorms brought a slew of tornados - over 500 in May alone, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nAnd all the while, rivers and lakes continued to fill and crest, breaking years of records, pouring over levees and barriers, covering highways, bridges and towns. There have been over 35 flood-related deaths in the region so far, according to NWS.\n\n\"The US is split in two for hundreds of miles,\" says Mr Hurst, who is the president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, describing the water's sprawl from north of Omaha, Nebraska, down past St Louis, Missouri.\n\nAs of 10 June, around 200 river gauges along the Mississippi, Missouri and Arkansas rivers are still reporting flood levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\"We've seen more flooding in the past decade than we've seen in the decades before. This has gone past that into something historic.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mississippi floodwaters surround a Missouri home\n\nEnvironmental scientist Prof Samuel Munoz of Northeastern University also says 2019 will make the history books.\n\nIt's \"unusual\" for the Great Plains and Midwest, he notes, to see this number of repeated strong storms and severe weather in one spring.\n\nPart of that could be because of El Niño - a natural weather event that brings unusually warm sea-surface temperatures to the Pacific.\n\n\"El Niño conditions tend to enhance precipitation and severe weather over the areas that are flooding,\" Prof Munoz explains.\n\n\"Manmade climate change intensifies these natural variations, causing more rain to fall in what would already have been a wet year.\"\n\nMore on climate change\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Large stretches of road across the Midwest remain closed due to flooding\n\nKeith Hillman, director of the emergency management team in Vilonia, Arkansas, says his city has seen over 4.5ft [1.4m] of rain since January.\n\n\"It's well above the normal rainfall this year and anytime you have that much rain, it's gotta go somewhere eventually.\n\n\"I've been told by our county judge that they think the river won't be at normal stages until the end of July.\"\n\nWhen I spoke to Mr Hillman last week, his team was preparing for nearby Lake Conway to flood. At one point, officials said the water levels in the lake's reservoir were rising a foot per hour.\n\n\"It's hard to control Mother Nature,\" Mr Hillman told me, resigned. \"This is just our time.\"\n\nBut the way these major rivers are managed could also be contributing to these historic floods.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A home falls into the river in Oklahoma\n\nThe Mississippi River system contains an elaborate network of dams, levees and spillways, run by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Prof Munoz says.\n\n\"These management efforts have straightened, steepened, and narrowed the river, and our research has shown that these changes cause floodwaters to flow higher and faster.\"\n\nSuch structures are undoubtedly needed from an economic standpoint, but Prof Munoz says the problem lies in the fact that these systems were designed for a mid-20th Century climate.\n\n\"As the climate continues to change, we need to have a conversation nationally and globally about how we are going to live and work in low-lying areas,\" he says. \"If we ignore this problem, our water management systems will continue to be overwhelmed - and we'll continue to have our assumptions of what is 'safe' from flooding challenged.\"\n\nUnlike some disasters, flooding - especially on this scale - is a long haul, says Lori Arnold, director of the Greater Arkansas American Red Cross.\n\nThe Red Cross has been operating 10 shelters in Arkansas and around as many in neighbouring states. In addition to providing food and a safe place to stay to hundreds, Ms Arnold notes the volunteers have been providing mental health services, too.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Missouri residents use a boat to get back to a home as floodwater from the Mississippi River continues to rise\n\nMidwesterners are proud of being self-sufficient, she says. Many try to last out the floods in their own homes as long as possible. But this year things have been different.\n\n\"People living on the riverbanks, they're used to flooding and they hear about this all the time,\" Ms Arnold says. \"The hardest thing for them is flooding fatigue.\"\n\nShe says many shelter residents have told her that they were reticent to leave their homes because of how many times official warnings had exaggerated the situation.\n\n\"So for those who actually had to leave, they're a bit in shock because they'd gotten immune to it.\"\n\nThe Mississippi and its tributary, the Missouri, make-up the longest river system in North America. Floods are expected - but 2019 harkens back to the worst of them. The swollen rivers this spring have broken a dam in one instance and dramatically breached levees across the region.\n\n\"In our part of the world, you think of 1952, 1993, and now we're going to think about 2019,\" Missouri farmer Blake Hurst says.\n\nIn 1993, following persistent spring and summer storms, the waters of the Mississippi lurched over their banks and flooded 400,000 sq miles across nine states. Fifty people died. Damages were close to $15bn (£11bn).\n\nIt rained nearly every day in June and July of 1993. Forecasts for 2019 predict between 33-50% chances of above-average rainfall on the Midwest's already water-logged soil.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Floodwater from the Mississippi River has overtaken much of the town of Foley, Missouri\n\nThis week, the National Weather Service had flood alerts along the Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas and Mississippi rivers. Waters are receding in parts, but the NWS reports 125 river gauges from Minnesota to Missouri predict a 50% or greater chance of flooding from June to August.\n\nOn Sunday, the Mississippi crested in St Louis at just over 46ft - its second-highest in history, and only 3.5ft short of its 1993 record, according to the NWS.\n\nAnd all along the Midwest, the river stands to break records from 1927 if it remains at flood levels through the summer. AccuWeather estimates the flooding damage along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers is already over $12bn.\n\nInteractive See flooding on the Mississippi by moving the slider button 7 May 2019 5 June 2018\n\nInteractive See the flooding near Claremore by moving the slider button 28 May 2019 9 May 2018\n\nBut, barring another system of severe storms, \"we're sort of on the downhill side, I hope\", Mr Hurst says. He adds: \"Just because we haven't had rain in a few days doesn't mean that people's homes are dry or that their farms aren't covered with water.\"\n\nAnd some of the farms that have flooded, he says, were still dealing with damage from local flooding in 2011.\n\nAs the floodwaters ebb and the acres of drowned land emerge again, a long clean-up process begins. The receding water leaves feet of sand and mud, rubbish and sewage in its wake, but it will be months yet before proper clean-up efforts can start - let alone farming.\n\nMr Hurst says some farmers believe climate change has caused the severe weather this year, while others blame improper management of river operations.\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether our problem is caused by poor management or climate change, we need to figure out how to do better,\" he tells me.\n\n\"Having said all that: Would any kind of management of the river prevented flooding in 2019? No. There's nothing that could have prevented this.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAdditional reporting by Halle Kendall",

(yes, you read that right).\n\nHe did, though, repeat his assertion that none of the candidates aside from him were being straight about the possibilities for Brexit.\n\nHe'll say, as many times as he can and with a fair amount of evidence to back him up, that the odds of the UK leaving on Halloween aren't that high. (Nothing of course is impossible, and plenty of the candidates say they will do everything to make that happen.)\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Andrea Leadsom reflected on mistakes in her campaign three years ago\n\nAnd as I write, early on Tuesday evening, Rory Stewart - Boris Johnson's fellow Old Etonian who predicts that they will be the final two - is on stage at a comedy venue launching his campaign proper.\n\nAnd TV presenter Lorraine Kelly was back - this time with a slapdown of the whole lot of the political class, prompting suggestions in the Westminster bubble that maybe she should be allowed to pick the winner, so the country could just get on with its important business.\n\nOutside of SW1, plenty of you might well agree.\n\nBut the hard reality bites today too. Labour has just announced that they are leading another cross-party attempt to grab control of the Commons.\n\nIf they're successful, they would try to introduce a law to block the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place, and to stop any future prime minister suspending Parliament so that we leave whatever happens - as has been suggested by some of the wannabe leaders.\n\nRight now, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey and, of course, the front runner Boris Johnson, are all suggesting the UK ought to leave at the end of October - Brexit or bust. You can read more about the candidates' different plans here.\n\nJust in case the candidates needed a reminder of what they'll inherit, the politician who wins this race might find that MPs have changed the law to kill off their solution to Brexit before they even call the removal vans to move their stuff to Number 10.\n\nOn Tuesday 18 June BBC One will be hosting a live election debate between the Conservative MPs who are still in the race.\n\nIf you would like to ask the candidates a question live on air, use the form below.

And having parents and guardians more involved when appropriate is good sense, and can only help, including helping save lives,\" said Sir Anthony.\n\nValue for money\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed a report from Philip Augar calling for a cut in tuition fees in England - saying the maximum should be reduced from £9,250 to £7,500 per year.\n\nThe survey showed that for the 29% of students who thought they were getting \"poor\" or \"very poor\" value for money, the biggest factor was the level of fees.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe proportion saying they were getting \"good\" or \"very good\" value had risen - but only to 41%.\n\nChris Skidmore, the universities minister, said that if fees were reduced as the Augar review recommended, then there would need to be \"top-up\" funding for universities to replace the lost income.\n\nSpeaking at the Hepi conference, he said that improving funding for further education should not be at the expense of higher education, saying \"you can't rob Peter to pay Paul\".\n\nHe argued that there should be more students going to university rather than less - and he reiterated his opposition to setting a minimum grade threshold, such as requiring students to get a least three D grades at A-level.\n\nMr Skidmore said this would be an unfair block on those who did not have the opportunity to get good A-levels at school, but who \"flourished later on in life\".\n\nBetter teaching\n\nThe student satisfaction survey showed that within the UK, students in Scotland, where there are no fees for Scottish students, were much more likely to think they had good value, compared with those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe most common driving factor for those with positive views was the quality of teaching - and the report suggested improving teaching was the way to increase perceptions of good value.\n\nBut the survey showed the average number of \"contact hours\", where students are directly taught in class, had not increased significantly - from 13.4 hours per week in 2015 to 13.9 hours this year.\n\nMr Hillman said the survey showed \"students want to be stretched, they want clearer feedback and they want more support for mental health challenges\".",

    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Security correspondent Frank Gardner looks at the evidence the US says proves Iran's involvement in Thursday's attacks\n\nThe crisis in the Gulf has moved up a gear, with the US providing the first element of the intelligence it insists demonstrates that Iran was responsible for Thursday's attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nAlthough much remains to be revealed about the incidents, as far as the Trump administration is concerned, the evidence is clear.\n\nThis inevitably raises questions about what happens next: how might the US respond? The stakes are high.\n\nWhat is the danger of a full-scale air and maritime conflict between Washington and Tehran?\n\nThe grainy video released by the Pentagon showing what is claimed to be a small Iranian vessel - its crew detaching an unexploded limpet mine from the hull of one of the two tankers attacked on Thursday - is a powerful first salvo in the battle to establish what actually happened.\n\nHowever, in the highly charged environment of the social media age, this is inevitably a struggle as much about perceptions as reality.\n\nTo their respective camps of critics, both the Iranian and Trump administrations are toxic.\n\nIran has denied from the outset any involvement, as it did with the four limpet-mine attacks on ships off the United Arab Emirates in May. The US has now blamed both episodes on Tehran. And there is a clear danger that this war of words could spill over into outright conflict.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mike Pompeo: \"Unprovoked attacks a clear threat to peace and security\"\n\nLast night, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo swiftly and categorically pointed the finger of blame at Iran.\n\n\"This assessment,\" he said, was \"based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.\"\n\nIran for its part was quick to deny any involvement in the incidents. Indeed it sought to deflect blame by arguing in effect that it was being framed.\n\n\"Somebody,\" an Iranian official asserted, \"is trying to destabilise relations between Iran and the international community.\"\n\nOdd chronology?\n\nOn the face of things, the US Navy's video is persuasive. But it still leaves many questions unanswered. It was after all recorded some time after the initial explosions - when the Iranians, it seems, according to the implication of the US narrative - were seeking to remove some of the incriminating evidence.\n\nBut more needs to be revealed about the chronology of these attacks. When, for example, were the mines actually attached to the vessels?\n\nThe US has remarkable intelligence gathering capabilities in the region, where there is already a powerful US naval presence. More information will undoubtedly be available and a forensic examination of the damage to the two vessels should also yield further evidence.\n\nHowever, the burden of the US case goes way beyond this most recent attacks. Iran, the Trump administration insists, has form.\n\nMr Pompeo made an expansive case, insisting that \"taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation, and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension\".\n\nThese are hefty charges and the question inevitably follows: what is the US prepared to do about it?\n\nConcerted diplomatic action might be one approach; an effort to marshal international condemnation together with an effort to further isolate Iran through additional economic sanctions.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards is estimated to have more than 150,000 active personnel\n\nBut there is little doubt that stepped up sanctions, rightly or wrongly, have contributed to the current situation, increasing the pressure on Tehran, perhaps to the extent that some elements in the country - maybe the Revolutionary Guard Corps which maintains autonomous naval forces of its own - has decided to strike back.\n\nSo now what happens? Could the US seek to take some kind of punitive military response?\n\nWhat will be the view of its allies among the Gulf States and farther afield? And what could be the consequences of military action ?\n\nDangerous times\n\nThere is a very real danger that Iran, if attacked, could launch a kind of hybrid war - both directly and through its proxies - carrying out sporadic and widely dispersed attacks on shipping and other targets, sending oil prices and insurance premiums up and perhaps encouraging further punitive responses.\n\nIt is an unpalatable prospect for all concerned, risking dangerous escalation. Nobody really thinks that either Iran or the US wants a full-scale conflict.\n\nFor the Americans, despite their considerable military power, an air and maritime war against Iran would raise all sorts of dangers.\n\nAnd President Trump, for all his sometimes bellicose rhetoric, has so far proved reluctant to take significant military action abroad. US strikes in Syria during his watch were largely symbolic.\n\nThe fear now is that Iran, through its own misreading of the situation, may have given the hawkish voices in the US administration the grounds they need to launch some kind of punitive response.\n\nThe danger, as ever, is for war by accident rather than by design.\n\nTehran and Washington are signalling their resolve to each other, but they may not be receiving quite the messages that each intends.\n\nIran, for example, may see the US build-up in the region partly as bluster and partly as an effort at intimidation in what it sees as its own backyard - intimidation that it is not disposed to accept.\n\nJust suppose elements in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, for example, misunderstand the signals.\n\nSuppose they believe that they have much more freedom to assert themselves in Gulf waters than the Americans are prepared to accept.\n\nIn other words, rather than as they may see it, \"pushing at the envelope\", they are straying into actions that Washington and its allies will simply not allow to go unpunished, This is a recipe for conflict, intentional or otherwise. These are dangerous times.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter?\n\nMany of Washington's allies, like France and Germany, are already urging caution.\n\nThe British foreign minister said that while the UK trusted the US, it would draw its own conclusion.\n\n\"We are going to make our own independent assessment, we have our processes to do that,\" Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Today programme. \"We have no reason not to believe the American assessment and our instinct is to believe it, because they are our closest ally.\"\n\nMr Trump must weigh up any response carefully.\n\nWhen he first came to office, there were many - even Republican foreign policy experts - who refused to have anything to do with his administration, insisting that his mercurial and erratic approach to foreign affairs would provoke a crisis.\n\nFor a time, that looked as though it might involve North Korea or maybe even Syria. But each time, the moment of drama passed.\n\nNow a fully fledged crisis is facing the White House. How it responds will have crucial implications, not just for the Middle East, but also for the wider pattern of relationships between the US and its traditional partners in the Gulf and elsewhere, many of whom are unsure of how to deal with this president and his unique diplomatic style.",

    "article" : "Image copyright REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe margin of success took his fellow candidates by surprise - but not the core of Boris Johnson's team.\n\nAfter many, many weeks of private campaigning, introducing Boris Johnson to the world of the spreadsheet, this morning one of his organisers wrote the number 114 and sealed it in an envelope.\n\nAt lunchtime, the announcement revealed the controversial former foreign secretary had indeed received exactly that number.\n\nThat is not just a marker of the level of Mr Johnson's support, but for the sometimes clownish politician, whose reputation has risen and fallen and then risen again, it's a sign that it is different this time.\n\nHis campaign has extended way beyond his old friends. The discipline his lieutenants are trying to instil is holding at this stage.\n\nBut his success today leaves him vulnerable.\n\nFrontrunner status is a precious commodity. It makes him the target for all of the others left in the race, for all of them to pitch themselves to those many MPs who feel strongly that he is wrong for the job.\n\nSo members of his campaign team tell me their motto is simple - do not die. His place in the final two of the race to become our prime minister is secure, unless he errs explosively. With Boris Johnson, that is not a secure bet. And once in that final duet, weeks of scrutiny and challenge await.\n\nThere is a choice for those who want to stop him now. Discussions are live tonight between the other camps in the race over what to do next.\n\nShould there be an effort to come together behind one candidate who could beat Mr Johnson?\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said tonight - arriving back at the Pall Mall mansion that used to be Mr Johnson's formal residence, of course - that he is the person to take him on. Although he had fewer votes than expected today, he's clearly not going to pull out.\n\nSajid Javid and Matt Hancock though, the home and health secretaries, met this afternoon after the results.\n\nSources close to Mr Hancock say he's \"mulling over\" what to do next. There's no final decision, but don't be hugely surprised if by Friday lunchtime he has withdrawn from the contest.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption One of the only things we can be sure of: The next prime minister will be a man\n\nRory Stewart though is not going anywhere. He is instead ramping up his rhetoric against his fellow Old Etonian (yes, he and Boris Johnson did not just go to the same school, but also to the same Oxford college), and talking boldly about how only he can be the person to take him on.\n\nGiven his place on the political spectrum frankly that seems extremely unlikely, however many views his videos get on Twitter.\n\nAnd while his team are extremely gung-ho, and he has built up some impressive momentum, some MPs from the so-called One Nation, (centre-ish) part of the Tory party are pretty cross, telling me that either Javid or Hancock had a decent crack if he would get out of the way.\n\nThere is plenty more of this political intrigue to come in the next week or so, whether it bores you to tears or is the insider manoeuvring that excites you. It's fluid, and there is, as I tediously probably always say, a long way to go.\n\nThere are two things we can be absolutely sure of, tonight Boris Johnson is looking hard to beat. And with Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom both out of the race, the next prime minister will be a man.",

There's evidence this can happen in response to low temperatures, low nutrient levels and other conditions associated with high elevations.\n\nBut people could have deliberately bred plants with higher levels of THC than wild varieties.\n\nIt's the earliest clear evidence of cannabis being used for its psychoactive properties. The plants appear to have been burnt as part of funerary rituals.\n\nThe scientists used a method called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to isolate and identify compounds preserved in the burners.\n\nTo their surprise, the chemical signature of the isolated compounds was an exact match to the chemical signature of cannabis.\n\nThe findings tally with other early evidence for the presence of cannabis from burials further north, in the Xinjiang region of China and in the Altai Mountains of Russia.\n\nIn addition, tests on human bones from the cemetery show that some of the people here did not grow up locally.\n\nNicole Boivin, director at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, said: \"The findings support the idea that cannabis plants were first used for their psychoactive compounds in the mountainous regions of eastern Central Asia, thereafter spreading to other regions of the world.\"\n\nThe study is published in the journal Science Advances.",

But it also needs regulatory oversight as well,\" he said.\n\nRegulation time?\n\nThe call for regulation of Facebook and the other US tech giants is getting louder - from Europe in particular.\n\nTech Tent also hears from European Commissioner Carlos Moedas and leading UK tech figure Hermann Hauser, who both insist that Europe is setting the pace - with the GDPR data privacy directive just one example.\n\nAnd Hermann Hauser has one radical solution to the huge power and dominant market share of Google, Amazon and Facebook - break them up.",

Millions of people died from starvation.\n\nDr Michael Baron, honorary fellow at the institute, said the end of rinderpest would mark the beginning of a new war on other diseases.\n\n\"The success we have achieved with rinderpest has been one of the main drivers for people saying we can do this with other animal diseases and other human diseases such as polio, mumps and measles. These diseases are eradicable and this should be done,\" he explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the lab where they study the world's most deadly diseases\n\nHuman catastrophe\n\nThe rinderpest virus is responsible for one of the worst catastrophes in history. During an outbreak in the 1890s, it killed between 80% and 90% of cattle in eastern and southern Africa. This caused mass starvation in the region.\n\nMillions of people died as a result. In Ethiopia alone, one-third of the human population was wiped out. The toll in lives was on a scale matched only by the Black Death in Europe.\n\nA vaccination campaign eventually brought the disease under control until it was declared to have been eradicated in the wild in 2011.\n\nBut thousands of samples of the virus remained in 40 laboratories across 36 countries. If there happened to be an accident, the disease could potentially leak out and cause devastation once again.\n\nTo prevent this, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) approved a few highly secure labs and encouraged other institutes to send their rinderpest samples to these facilities.\n\nAmong them is the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, which has led efforts to record the genetic information contained in each sample and then destroy it.\n\nResearchers have been reluctant to destroy lab samples of deadly viruses in case they are needed to create a vaccine should the disease ever re-emerge. But a digital record of the virus's genetic code means that this is no longer an issue.\n\nAnd so Pirbright has been able to destroy all its samples which account for most of the laboratory rinderpest virus in the world.\n\nDr Samia Metwally, of the FAO, hopes that Pirbright's success will encourage other holding facilities to follow suit so that it is completely eliminated from the face of the Earth.\n\n\"This is a huge step by Pirbright. It sets a precedent for other countries to do the same.\"\n\nDr Monique Eloit, the OIE's director-general, told BBC News that she was \"very happy\" about the development.\n\n\"All the work done by farmers, veterinarians and scientists for such a long time is on track to minimise the risk of the re-emergence of rinderpest,\" she said.\n\nThe government's chief vet, Dr Christine Middlemiss, welcomed the news. \"It is such a devastating disease. 100% of susceptible animals become infected and die from the virus. So to have that removed as a threat is fantastic,\" she said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter",

    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Anne Soy reports from the Uganda-DR Congo border\n\nThe World Health Organization has decided not to declare a global emergency over the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe WHO said Ebola was \"very much an emergency\" in the region, but it did not pose a global threat.\n\nHowever, it was damning of countries for giving less than half the money needed to deal with the disease.\n\nThe deadly outbreak - the second largest in history - has killed more than 1,400 people.\n\nThis week cases were detected across the border in Uganda, though the virus is not yet spreading there.\n\nDeclaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern is one of the most important acts the WHO can take.\n\nIt has done so only four times before - including for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa which killed more than 11,000 people.\n\nSuch a decision usually means getting more money and healthcare workers to tackle an outbreak - or political support to stop the fighting to let medics get the job done.\n\nSo why is Ebola not a global emergency?\n\nThis was not a straightforward decision.\n\nDr Preben Aavitsland, the acting chair of the WHO's emergency committee, said there was extensive debate and differing views at the emergency meeting.\n\nThe outbreak met some of the criteria for a global emergency as it was both an extraordinary event and risked international spread.\n\nHowever, he said efforts on the ground \"would not be enhanced\" by declaring an emergency.\n\nDr Aavitsland said: \"This is not a global emergency, it is an emergency in DRC, it is a severe emergency.\"\n\nBut he warned declaring an emergency could lead to border closures or airlines refusing to fly to DRC, which could do more harm than good.\n\n\"There is nothing to gain, but there is a lot to lose,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO has previously discussed whether the Ebola outbreak in DRC should be declared an emergency on two occasions.\n\nBoth times it decided not to, in part because Ebola was deemed a threat in only in the region rather than internationally.\n\nHow bad is the situation in DRC?\n\nThe outbreak started in August 2018 and is affecting two provinces in DRC - North Kivu and Ituri.\n\nMore than 2,100 people have been infected and over 1,400 have died.\n\nIt took 224 days for the number of cases to reach 1,000, but just a further 71 days to reach 2,000.\n\nThere are some positive signs with the number of new cases slowing - there were 54 cases in the past week compared with 88 in each of the two previous weeks.\n\nHowever, 54 cases is still more than the totality of many Ebola outbreaks.\n\nTackling the disease has been complicated by conflict in the region - between January and May there were more than 40 attacks on health facilities.\n\nAnother problem is distrust of healthcare workers with about a third of deaths being in the community rather than at a specialist Ebola treatment centre.\n\nIt means those people are not seeking treatment and risk spreading the disease to neighbours and relatives.\n\nHas the virus spread to other countries?\n\nTwo people have died from Ebola in neighbouring Uganda - a five-year-old boy and his 50-year-old grandmother.\n\nThey were members of a family that crossed the border from DRC.\n\nWhile the WHO says such cases are of \"grave concern\" is says there is no evidence of the virus spreading in Uganda.\n\nTwenty-seven people are said to have been in contact with the infected family. They have all been restricted to their homes and will be offered the Ebola vaccine.\n\nIs the world doing enough to help?\n\nThe WHO is clear that more needs to be done.\n\nIt said that between February and July it needed $98m to tackle the outbreak, but it was facing a shortfall of $54m.\n\nSir Jeremy Farrar, from the Wellcome medical research charity, said: \"A step up in the response with full international support is critical if we're to bring the epidemic to an end and ensure protection for the communities at risk.\n\n\"The response in DRC remains overstretched and underfunded.\"\n\nWhat is Ebola?\n\nImage copyright BSIP/Getty Images",

    "article" : "It is June 1998 and Paula Rego is furious. Her people, the Portuguese people, had not turned up in sufficient numbers to vote in the recently held national referendum to change the country's conservative abortion law.\n\nThe London-based artist was appalled.\n\nAs someone who had endured the life-threatening brutality of back-street abortions she was dismayed the Portuguese - particularly the women - had passed up the chance to legalise the termination of pregnancies on request up to 10 weeks from conception.\n\nThe wholly avoidable deaths and distress suffered by thousands of women resorting to illegal abortions every year would continue. No wonder her father had said Portugal was no place for a woman, before packing off his talented teenage daughter to England to hone her painterly skills at The Slade School of Fine Art in London.\n\nShe sat in her Camden Town studio and fumed, determined to do something about the situation; to change public opinion back home; to make a difference. Which she did (the law was changed in 2007). By doing what she always did when overwhelmed with anger. She created a group of troubling, ominous images.\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Paula Rego's abortion series began with this dark and searingly honest Triptych, 1998\n\nRego's abortion pictures are as confrontational and direct as a John Humphrys interview.\n\nThere's no flim-flam, no tip-toeing around the topic: she gets straight to the point… which is darkly ambiguous.\n\nShe is both explicit and vague.\n\nThere is an equivocation that makes for uncomfortable viewing. Her truth resides in psychological complexity however awkward it may be. To Rego, the grim reality of a back-street abortion is not intellectually straightforward. It is not simply a case of a bad thing happening.\n\nLook at any of the imposingly large pictures she made in this series and you will be disturbed.\n\nThere is an uneasy eroticism bound up in the pain and the squalor. The schoolgirls and young women depicted challenge the unseen figure with a physicality and preparedness. Have they girded up their loins in anticipation of an impending termination or something else?\n\nWelcome to Paula Rego World, where there is always something nasty in the woodshed.\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption With Untitled No. 5, 1998 and others in her abortion series, Paula Rego says \"they are not pictures of victims\"\n\nTo see a Rego picture is to be thrust into the midst of a sinister gothic drama. A fat-ankled lady wearing a walnut-like skirt bends down to lift a prone dog by its front legs in Snare (1987). She leans forward as if to give the animal a sensual kiss, a red rose in the foreground suggests love. Near it, a crab lies powerless on its back mirroring the dog's vulnerability. It is rich with symbolism and menace.\n\nIt is also technically very good.\n\nThe red-to-brown palette has the tonal harmony of Picasso's impeccable portrait of Gertrude Stein (1905-6). The suggested volume of the figures is as convincing as a mirage in the desert. And the weight the lady's legs bear, and pressure of the grip with which she holds the dog, are palpable.\n\nIt is a very good figurative painting.\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego Image caption Snare, 1987 is a key work full of symbolism - with the skirt concealing \"secrets\"\n\nIt marks the moment Rego found her signature style.\n\nThere had always been a strong narrative element to her work, whether back in the 1960s when she was making cut-up collages like The Imposter (1964) critiquing the Estado novo authoritarian regime in Portugal. Or, in the early '80s with abstracted, cartoon-like paintings such as Red Monkey Offers Bear A Poisoned Dove (1981), lampooning the love triangle she constructed between her husband and her paramour.\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Paula Rego criticised the Portuguese dictatorship in works like The Imposter, 1964\n\nBut these were works in progress towards the stylised tableaus and heavy-featured figures that are now instantly recognisable as a Paula Rego. Hers is an idiosyncratic aesthetic heightened later by the use of oil pastel crayons instead of acrylic paint, a mid-career decision made - I am told - in part to help her stop smoking.\n\nThe results are impressive.\n\nTurn 180 degrees from the Abortion Series hanging in the central space of the MK Gallery, and there, on the opposite wall, are her Dog Women pictures from the early 1990s.\n\nThey were inspired by the French Impressionist painter, Edgar Degas. He was an artist famous for his use of pastels and elevated perspective, from which he portrayed dainty dancers in ballet rehearsals. His representations of a woman's physique and inner life were voyeuristic, with a hint of the dirty-old-man about them. Rego's couldn't be more different.\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Degas' viewpoint of looking down on the model can be seen in Rego's Sleeper, 1994\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dancers, 1884-1885 by Degas, who influenced Rego with what she says were \"his marvellous use of pastels\"\n\nHer Dog Women are more like werewolves; snarling creatures that are both loyal and fiercely independent. The pictures are a response to the death of her husband, the artist Victor (Vic) Willing whom she met while a student at The Slade.\n\nShe considered Vic her intellectual and artistic superior, a point of view he was in no rush to counter. His critical eye helped her work develop but petrified his own. Life got complicated. He was already married. She went back to Portugal.\n\nVic left his wife and went to live with Paula. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. They both had affairs. Her father died. Vic took over the family business and ran it into the ground. They returned to London, penniless. Paula found a lover to help pay the way. Vic began to paint again shortly before he died.\n\nTheirs was a passionate, painful, profound relationship, which Rego renders in pastel with disarming sincerity. Woman becomes dog-like, part domesticated and part wild animal. She lies on her owner's jacket in Sleeper (1994), is kicked out of bed in Bad Dog (1994), and roars in rage in Dog Woman (1994).\n\nImage copyright Manuela Morais Image caption Paula Rego with her husband Victor Willing, with whom she had a passionate but complicated relationship\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Paula Rego's belief that \"every woman's a dog woman, not downtrodden, but powerful\" is reflected in Dog Woman, 1994\n\nBut it is in Sit (1994) that Rego captures the specific and the universal of her marriage to Vic with an emotional intensity you won't quickly forget.\n\nThe female figure is doing as she has been told, sitting obediently in her chair. Her hands are behind her back, possibly bound. Her feet are crossed in the manner of the crucified Christ. She is pregnant.\n\nShe looks up and away at her tormentor, her owner, her lover. She is trapped, subjugated, but in no way tamed. Her eyes blaze with defiance, her body emits power. There is an air of sexuality and violence, love and hate; beauty and the grotesque.\n\nIt is a uniquely good picture.\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Obedience and defiance are apparent in Sit, 1994, which seems to be a stark metaphor about Rego's marriage\n\nIt's not the best image ever created. It is not even the best image Paula Rego has ever created - The Dance (not in this exhibition) - is better.\n\nBut it is exceptional.\n\nWe've seen plenty of male artists picturing woman in myriad different ways, but who else has painted the world from a female point of view in the manner described by Paula Rego?\n\nLouise Bourgeois and Frida Kahlo had similar concerns, and expressed them just as unflinchingly, But Rego's voice is more literary, painterly and poetic in the way of Edgar Allan Poe. She references the Brontë sisters, Edvard Munch, William Hogarth and Francisco Goya.\n\nShe is a romantic surrealist with a satirist's cutting edge.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Duchess of Alba, 1797 was painted by the Spanish artist Goya who influenced the Portuguese-born Rego\n\nImage copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption The figure in Angel, 1998 is a symbol of female power and strength\n\nQuite why she is not more famous is difficult to fathom. Maybe her gender and style went against her? A bit too much for all those buttoned-up male museum directors whose stripped back modernist tastes ruled the roost for far too long.\n\nTheir time has come and gone.\n\nThe game is changing.\n\nI can't recall another exhibition season quite like this summer's, when there are so many monographic shows dedicated to female artists being staged across the country.\n\nIt brings to mind the female figure in Sit. She knew her time would come. And so it has. It is now.\n\nRecent reviews by Will Gompertz\n\nFollow Will Gompertz on Twitter",

    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amazon executive Werner Vogels on the ethics of facial recognition\n\n\"I see Amazon as a technology company that just happened to do retail,\" begins Werner Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer.\n\n\"When Jeff [Bezos] started Amazon, he wasn't thinking about starting a bookshop. He was really fascinated by the internet.”\n\nOnly \"mortal humans\", he tells me in an interview, ever saw Amazon as merely a retailer. So the question now is: what will Amazon become next? And are mere mortals ready for it?\n\nIts recent Re:Mars event in Las Vegas demonstrated clearly - through presentations about machine-learning, robotics and space - that the firm is going through a transition phase that, if successful, will redefine its relationship with the public.\n\nAmazon's incredible, sophisticated systems are no longer being used just to serve up good deals, fast delivery times, or cheap web storage. Its big data capabilities are now the tool of police forces, and maybe soon the military. In the corporate world, Amazon is positioning itself to be the “brains” behind just about everything.\n\nIn short, New Amazon could make today's Amazon look quaint in both scale and power.\n\nNext major phase\n\nAmazon, of course, knows this. Which is why, for an entire week earlier this month, the firm, typically reluctant to engage too deeply with the press, did so with enthusiasm: dinners, interviews, and remarkably frank discussions about its ambitions.\n\nAmong the Re:Mars speakers was Mr Vogels. He’s considered - alongside Mr Bezos - one of the company's true visionaries, in part thanks to his creation of Amazon Web Services, which, as of now, accounts for most of Amazon's profits.\n\nAWS essentially meant small companies which would not be able to afford big severs of their own now could - and that server space would grow (or shrink) in accordance with their needs.\n\nAs a result, Amazon provides the infrastructure backbone for major firms such as AirBnB and Netflix, as well as more than one million other clients who collectively give Amazon \"control\" of large swathes of the web. When AWS suffered a technical glitch in 2017, tech site Gizmodo said it simply \"destroyed the internet\". There are competing major cloud platforms - from Microsoft and Google - but AWS is on top.\n\nThe firm is now looking to have a similar impact with the next major phase in computing: machine-learning and artificial intelligence. ML and AI, for short.\n\n“There's only a certain set of problems for which you need to build new algorithms,” Mr Vogels tells me, suggesting for everything else, companies should just use Amazon.\n\n“The use of machine-learning will greatly explode if everyone can do it.”\n\nHe wants to offer companies access to technologies they could not create themselves, such as Textract (“automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents”) or Lex, which uses the same technology as the Alexa voice assistant to turn voice recordings into text.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Amazon is best known by consumers for its retail website\n\n‘Not my decision’\n\nAmong the tools it is offering, Amazon’s image recognition product is the most controversial. For a per-minute fee of a few pence, Amazon Rekognition can scan video footage and, for example, pick up people’s faces that can then be checked against a client’s database.\n\nCivil rights groups have called it “perhaps the most dangerous surveillance technology ever developed”, and called for Amazon to stop selling it to government agencies, particularly police forces. City supervisors in San Francisco banned its use, saying the software is not only intrusive, but biased - it’s better at recognising white people than black and Asian people.\n\nMr Vogels doesn’t feel it's Amazon’s responsibility to make sure Rekognition is used accurately or ethically.\n\n“That’s not my decision to make,” he tells me.\n\n“This technology is being used for good in many places. It’s in society’s direction to actually decide which technology is applicable under which conditions.\n\n“It’s a societal discourse and decision - and policy-making - that needs to happen to decide where you can apply technologies.”\n\nHe likens ML and AI to steel mills. Sometimes steel is used to make incubators for babies, he says, but sometimes steel is used to make guns.\n\n‘Add a comma’\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amazon’s head of Alexa, Dave Limp on privacy concerns\n\nAmazon’s new forays will attract scrutiny. In its immediate future, it - along with other tech giants - has to answer claims of being anti-competitive, and calls from some presidential candidates for it to be broken up. If it succeeds in its vision to use data to provide ML and AI to the masses, defending itself might become more difficult.\n\nAmazon will need to answer continued questioning about how it handles user privacy, and whether it is being entirely up-front with users when it comes to how data is stored and analysed.\n\nA small taste of this has come from the recent furore over its Alexa smart voice assistant, more than 100 million of which have been sold worldwide.\n\nReports earlier this year revealed how in some instances, isolated, anonymised recordings were being listened to by human staff - a possibility you could argue isn’t explicitly stated in the firm’s privacy policy.\n\n“It’s a tiny fraction of 1% of the voice recordings,” explained Dave Limp, Amazon’s head of Alexa, to the BBC.\n\n“And obviously customers have complete control of those voice recordings. So if anybody's concerned, they can delete those recordings.”\n\nHe conceded, however, that the company could perhaps make it clearer to its customers in future.\n\n“I think we could add a comma and be more specific,” he said of the firm’s privacy policy.\n\nWe’ll have to wait and see if it actually does.\n\nImage copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon was criticised for not giving enough information about what is done with data gathered by its smart speakers\n\nWork to do\n\nAmazon points to the many benefits this kind of technology can bring at scale - particularly machine-learning efforts that are able to sift through information at a rate no human team, however large, ever could.\n\nFor instance, Rekognition is being used by an anti-sex-trafficking non-profit organisation, Thorn, to scrape classified ad sites and search for matches against a database of missing teenagers.\n\nBut events like Re:Mars demonstrate that Amazon knows it has work to do in gaining the public’s trust in order to go ahead with its ambitions.\n\nOne non-Amazon guest on stage, the AI pioneer Andrew Ng, gave a pretty scathing review of the technology industry’s reputation - and food for thought for his hosts.\n\n“Even as we lead the world through multiple waves of technological disruption, we’ve not always provided the best leadership.\n\n“With the rise of the internet, we’ve created tremendous wealth, but we also contributed to wealth inequality.\n\n“Let’s make sure that this time, with the rise of AI, we take everyone along with us.”\n\n_______\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

A policy may well allow appropriate lunchtime drinking. It doesn't have to be a zero-tolerance policy.\"\n\nMr Willmott said having a policy on drinking made it easier for managers to raise the issue if there was a problem and to highlight the support available.",

    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iranian TV footage shows a burning tanker\n\nTwo oil tankers have been significantly damaged in suspected attacks in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nThe Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous with 23 crew members aboard and Norway's Front Altair with 23 people were abandoned after the blasts. Iran and the US say they evacuated the crew.\n\nIt is unclear what caused the blasts coming amid high US-Iran tensions.\n\nA senior Iranian official told the BBC: \"Iran has no connection with the incident.\"\n\nThe suspected attack in one of the world's busiest oil routes comes a month after four oil tankers were attacked off the United Arab Emirates.\n\nNo group or country has admitted May's incident, which also caused no casualties.\n\nThe US at the time blamed Iran - but Tehran denied the accusations.\n\nOil prices jumped as much as 4% after Thursday's incident.\n\nThe Gulf of Oman lies at one end of the strategic Strait of Hormuz - a vital shipping lane through which hundreds of millions of dollars of oil pass.\n\nWhat do we know about the explosions?\n\nThe cause has not been confirmed.\n\nThe Front Altair had been \"attacked\", the Norwegian Maritime Authority said, leading to three explosions on board.\n\nWu I-fang, a spokesman for Taiwan's CPC Corp oil refiner, which chartered the Front Altair, said it was carrying 75,000 tonnes of naphtha and was \"suspected of being hit by a torpedo\", although this has not been confirmed.\n\nOther unverified reports suggested a mine attack.\n\nThe ship's owner, Frontline, said the vessel was on fire - but denied reports in Iran media it had sunk.\n\nThe operator of the Kokuka Courageous, BSM Ship Management, said its crew abandoned ship and were rescued by a passing vessel.\n\nThe tanker was carrying methanol and was not in danger of sinking, a spokesman said.\n\nIt is currently located about 130km (80 miles) from Fujairah in the UAE and 16 miles from Iran. The cargo remains intact.\n\nThe key thing now is to determine exactly what caused the damage to the two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and that will provide powerful clues as to who may have carried out the attacks.\n\nThe US has a powerful naval presence in the region and will have a range of intelligence assets to draw upon.\n\nA US official has already noted that they believe that they will be able to recover enough debris from the attacks \"to come up with solid evidence for tracing them back to their source\".\n\nWhat happens then is a question of strategic judgement.\n\nCountries like France and Germany are already urging caution and pressing for a de-escalation.\n\nBut an attack on two merchant vessels in international waters is a hugely significant act.\n\nAnd these latest attacks - unlike the sabotage with limpet mines a month ago - risked causing significant loss of life.\n\nWho came to the rescue?\n\nIranian state media said Iran had rescued the crew members of both vessels and they had been taken to the port of Jask.\n\nImage copyright Frederick A Terry/Artjom Lofitski Image caption The 21 crew on the Kokuka Courageous (L) and 23 on the Front Altair have been rescued\n\nThe US 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, said it had sent the USS Bainbridge to assist.\n\nSpokesman Josh Frey said in a statement: \"US naval forces in the region received two separate distress calls at 06:12 local time (03:12 GMT) and a second one at 07:00.\"\n\nThe US Navy later said 29 crew members from the Kokuka Courageous were taken on board the USS Bainbridge.\n\nWhy are US-Iran tensions so high?\n\nIn 2018, the US pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal reached in 2015 that was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities.\n\nThe move was strongly criticised by a number of countries, including America's closest allies.\n\nIn May, President Donald Trump tightened US sanctions on Iran - mainly targeting its oil sector.\n\nIran then announced it was suspending some commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nIn recent months the US has strengthened its forces in the Gulf - saying there was a danger of Iranian attacks.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter?\n\nIt has sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the region.\n\nIn response, Iran has accused the US of aggressive behaviour.\n\nThose tensions rose markedly after the 12 May limpet mine attacks in the UAE.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC was invited on board the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea\n\nThe UAE blamed an unnamed \"state actor\".\n\nThe US said that actor was Iran, an accusation Tehran has denied.\n\nHow has the world reacted?\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres condemned Thursday's blasts.\n\nHe told the Security Council that the world cannot afford \"a major confrontation in the Gulf region\".\n\nMeanwhile, the EU called for \"maximum restraint\", while Russia said no-one should jump to conclusions or use the incident to put pressure on Iran, a Russian ally.\n\nThe incident is expected to be discussed at a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council later on Thursday.\n\nPaolo d'Amico, chairman of the tanker association, Intertanko, said the two vessels had been attacked, and expressed concern about dangers to other crews.\n\n\"If the waters are becoming unsafe, the [oil] supply to the entire Western world could be at risk,\" he said.",

    "article" : "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People took to the streets this week in Hong Kong to protest against proposed changes to the extradition bill.\n\nChanges to Hong Kong's extradition law could hurt the autonomy that has made it one of Asia's main financial hubs.\n\nThe government is seeking to allow extraditions to mainland China, saying it makes sure Hong Kong remains a \"safe city for residents and business\".\n\nThe proposed changes led to widespread protests in Hong Kong this week and sparked some of the worst violence seen there in decades.\n\nMany worry that Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre is at risk.\n\n\"The passage of the proposed legislation would undermine Hong Kong's status both as a hub for multinational firm operations and as a global financial centre,\" said Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nSo what are the proposed changes?\n\nThe changes will allow for extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoings, such as murder and rape.\n\nOfficials have said Hong Kong courts will have the final say whether to grant such extradition requests, and suspects accused of political and religious crimes will not be extradited.\n\nSeveral commercial offences such as tax evasion have been removed from the list of extraditable offences.\n\nBut Hong-Kong based lawyer Antony Dapiran said this does not mean business people are \"off the hook\".\n\n\"Even though there is some reassurance in the business community that those white collar crimes have been excluded... that doesn't necessarily mean that people are therefore free of risk,\" Mr Dapiran said.\n\n\"There are many other ways that someone can be extradited under the current bill for offences other than the offence that they are actually wanted (for).\"\n\nWhat has the business reaction been so far?\n\nCompanies have proved reluctant to openly speak about the extradition bill for fear that their businesses in mainland China could suffer consequences.\n\nPushing the bill through would risk \"shooting Hong Kong in the foot,\" Tara Joseph, president of The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said in a recent newspaper interview.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hong Kong has long been a hub for global financial firms and multination corporations doing business in Asia.\n\nBoth the British Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, refused to comment when contacted by the BBC.\n\nAndrew Coflan, analyst at New York-based political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said that the foreign business community was worried.\n\n\"Hong Kong has served as a gateway to Asia for flows of goods and capital,\" said Mr Coflan.\n\n\"But the passage of the extradition bill would turn it from a special legal entity into just another Chinese city, from a corporate risk perspective. The key risk is one of diverted or withdrawn investment.\"\n\nWhat happens to its special status?\n\nThe US, which is embroiled in a trade and technology dispute with China, has been vocal about its concerns surrounding the Hong Kong extradition bill.\n\nThe US expressed \"grave concern\" about the Hong Kong government's proposed amendments which \"could damage Hong Kong's business environment\" and subject American citizens there \"to China's capricious judicial system,\" Morgan Ortagus, spokesman at the US State Department said during a recent news briefing.\n\n\"The continued erosion of the 'One Country, Two Systems' framework puts at risk Hong Kong's long-established special status in international affairs,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Hong Kong government is seeking to allow extraditions to mainland China.\n\nIn 1984, Britain and China signed an agreement where Hong Kong would enjoy \"a high degree of autonomy\" when it returned to China in 1997 under the principle of \"one country, two systems.\"\n\nAs a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected.\n\nIn the US, Hong Kong's special status is recognized under the US Hong Kong Policy Act but this now appears to be under scrutiny.\n\nUS lawmakers have introduced a bill to amend the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. The amendment requires the US Secretary of State to \"issue an annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy to justify special treatment\" by the US.\n\n\"The bigger issue is probably that the global perception of Hong Kong as a separate part of China is under threat. And that includes official recognition of Hong Kong as a separate customs, immigration, tax and legal jurisdiction,\" said David Webb, editor of Webb-site.com and long-time resident of Hong Kong.\n\n\"If Hong Kong loses its separate status then, for example, all of the duties that America has applied to Chinese exports would apply to Hong Kong exports. And any prohibitions on transfers of high grade technology to China would apply to Hong Kong as well.\"\n\nAny impact on Hong Kong's economy?\n\nHong Kong saw its worst violence in decades this week, with some government offices and banks closing due to the disruption.\n\nStandard Chartered said on Friday the branches which were closed earlier in the week would resume operations.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protestors and police clashed this week in Hong Kong in the worst violence in the city in decades.\n\nSome analysts expect protests to continue as long as the bill is being considered. Further protests are expected on Sunday.\n\nBut Capital Economics, pointing to the fallout of the 2014 Occupy Hong Kong protests, expects the economic impact to be limited.\n\n\"The 2014 Occupy Hong Kong protests provide a useful benchmark. They brought gridlock to large parts of Hong Kong Island for over 70 days, but there was no noticeable effect on either retail sales or tourism arrivals,\" it said in a research note.\n\n\"So even if the current protests last for several weeks, the impact on the economy is likely to be minimal. We are not changing our GDP growth forecasts for this year.\"\n\nHowever, analysts say other places in Asia like Singapore stand to benefit if the proposed changes go through, undermining Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.\n\n\"The main beneficiary of this development is likely to be Singapore, which has a strong legal framework and no extradition agreement with China,\" said Mr Lardy from the Peterson Institute.",

A fitness hearing is not required.\"\n\nLast week, a restriction on publishing photos of the suspect's face was lifted.\n\n'New Zealand's darkest day'\n\nThe suspect was arrested on 15 March for his alleged involvement in the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre, both located in Christchurch.\n\nHe allegedly drove first to the Al Noor mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance.\n\nHe allegedly fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. The attack was live-streamed from a head-mounted camera.\n\nVictims of the Christchurch shootings\n\nFifty-one people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city. Here are some of their stories.\n\nThe suspect then allegedly drove about 5km (three miles) to the Linwood mosque and killed more people.\n\nAddressing the nation in the wake of the attack, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called it one of the country's \"darkest days\".\n\nThe gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines - the part of the gun which stores ammunition - so they could hold more bullets.\n\nHe is currently being kept in isolation at the Auckland Prison in Paremoremo, considered New Zealand's toughest prison.",

    "article" : "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Crowds also watched the service on a screen outside the Sydney Opera House\n\nThousands of Australians have honoured the nation's third-longest serving leader, Bob Hawke, in a state memorial service at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nMr Hawke was prime minister from 1983 to 1991 - a period of immense national reforms. He died last month aged 89.\n\nHe was honoured as an \"inspirational\" figure in a service attended by his family and many prominent Australians, including five former prime ministers.\n\nMr Hawke launched his successful bid for PM at the opera house in 1983.\n\nHe went on to win four elections - still a record for a Labor Party leader - and achieve record approval ratings. Together with successor Paul Keating, Mr Hawke is credited with modernising Australia's economy.\n\nAmong other legacies, he created Australia's universal Medicare healthcare system, promoted large-scale conservation efforts, and outlawed workplace gender discrimination.\n\nHis wife, Blanche d'Alpuget, said that his death had prompted \"a national outpouring of grief\".\n\n\"Today, this memorial service marks the transition from the grief of loss to the celebration of a life triumphantly well lived,\" she told the service.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five key moments from Bob Hawke's life\n\nIn his tribute, Prime Minister Scott Morrison described Australia as \"a nation Bob Hawke loved and that deeply loved him in return\".\n\nAmong hundreds of people in the sold-out hall were former prime ministers Mr Keating, John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, as well as current Labor leader Anthony Albanese.\n\nThousands more watched the service on a screen outside, with some carrying tributes on placards.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nFormer prime minister Julia Gillard, who is chairing a summit overseas, said in a video message: \"A million words could be written and a million more spoken about Bob Hawke, such is the breadth of his achievement.\n\n\"But for me, the essence of the Bob I knew is caught by one word - inspiration... He inspired the nation to embrace a new and better future.\"\n\nOthers celebrated Mr Hawke for his \"larrikin\" humour, resolve, and preparedness to show emotion.\n\nMr Hawke cried publicly a number of times in office - most famously in 1989 at a memorial service at Parliament House following the crackdown on Chinese students at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\n\nIt prompted him to offer asylum to Chinese students who were in Australia - a decision which ultimately granted permanent visas to 42,000 people.\n\nMs d'Alpuget used her speech to thank Chinese Australians for their condolences, saying \"in no country besides Australia did he have more friends... than in China\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Paul Keating (left) and Bob Hawke in 1990\n\nMr Keating drew laughs when he told the service that he and Mr Hawke would sometimes \"criticise one another to immediate staff... often heavy criticisms\", but said the pair were united in delivering significant reforms.\n\n\"What matters is the value of the legacy, its quality and its endurance,\" he said, adding that Mr Hawke's was \"five-star and 24 carat\".",

    "article" : "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Security correspondent Frank Gardner looks at the evidence the US says proves Iran's involvement in Thursday's attacks\n\nUS President Donald Trump has dismissed Iran's insistence it had no involvement with the attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nMr Trump cited footage that Washington says shows Iranian forces in a small boat taking an unexploded mine off the hull of one of the ships.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the truth needed to be \"clearly established\".\n\nRussia has warned against drawing \"hasty conclusions\".\n\nThe blasts came a month after four oil tankers were damaged in an attack off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. The US blamed Iran for that attack, but did not produce evidence. Iran also denied those accusations.\n\nTensions between the US and Iran have escalated significantly since US President Donald Trump took office in 2017. He abandoned a nuclear deal that was brokered by the Obama administration and significantly tightened sanctions on Iran.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iranian TV footage shows a burning tanker\n\nWhat did Trump say?\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, he said Iran \"did do it\".\n\n\"I guess one of the mines didn't explode and it's probably got essentially Iran written all over it. And you saw the boat at night trying to take the mine off and successfully took the mine off the boat, and that was exposed,\" he said.\n\nHe also said it was unlikely that Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz - a vital shipping lane through which a third of the world's seaborne oil passes every year - but if it did, the strait would not remain closed \"for long\".\n\nMr Trump's intervention came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to carry out the attacks and, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping showed Iran was behind it.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the US would be sharing intelligence to try to \"build international consensus to this international problem\".\n\nHow has Iran responded?\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani on Friday accused the US of posing \"a serious threat to stability in the Middle East\", without referring directly to the attacks in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nHe reiterated a call for international parties to the 2015 nuclear deal to honour their commitments, following a unilateral withdrawal by the Trump administration.\n\nForeign Minister Javad Zarif on Twitter accused the US of making an allegation \"without a shred of factual or circumstantial evidence\" and attempting to \"sabotage diplomacy\".\n\nThe footage released by the US on Thursday is rather more convincing than the circumstantial evidence it had provided earlier.\n\nThe small white patrol craft in the video is typical of the type used by Iran's IRGC (Revolutionary Guards) Navy in the Gulf. In recent years, the IRGC Navy has steadily supplanted Iran's conventional navy all along Iran's Gulf coast, from its border with Iraq in the north all the way down to Pakistan and the Arabian Sea. Its forces have built up a formidable flotilla of small, high-speed, hard-to-detect attack craft armed with mines, missiles, torpedoes and drones.\n\nIRGC commandos regularly practise covert operations and simulated attacks. Some of their craft have come in close proximity to US Navy warships in the Gulf in recent years and there remains the risk of a clash at sea.\n\nIran has denied any involvement in Thursday's attacks, saying they were carried out by someone looking to derail Iran's relations with the international community. There will likely be doubts in Tehran as to whether this video is genuine.\n\nWhat we know about the explosions\n\nAccording to the US account of events, US naval forces in the region received distress calls from the Norwegian-owned Front Altair at 06:12 (02:12 GMT) and from the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous at 07:00, following explosions, and moved towards the area.\n\nIt said the USS Bainbridge observed Iranian naval boats operating in the area in the hours after the explosions, and later removing the unexploded mine from the side of the Kokuka Courageous.\n\nThe crews of both vessels were evacuated to other ships nearby. Both Iran and the US later released pictures showing rescued crew members on board their vessels.\n\nBSM Ship Management, which manages the Kokuka Courageous, said the ship's crew abandoned ship after observing a fire and an unexploded mine.\n\nHowever Yutaka Katada, the president of the ship's operator, Kokuka Sangyo, said members of the crew had reported \"that the ship was attacked by a flying object\".\n\nThe Kokuka Courageous was about 30km (20 miles) off the Iranian coast when it sent its emergency call.\n\nThe Front Altair was carrying naphtha, a petrol product, from the United Arab Emirates to Taiwan. The Kokuka Courageous was carrying methanol from Saudi Arabia to Singapore.\n\nAccording to global satellite monitoring company Iceye, the damage to the Front Altair caused some oil spill in the waters around the ship.\n\nImage copyright Iceye Image caption A radar satellite image shows suspected oil slicks in the water around the Front Altair\n\nOil prices jumped as much as 4% after Thursday's incident.\n\nWhy are US-Iran tensions so high?\n\nIn 2018, the US pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal reached in 2015 that was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities. The move was strongly criticised by a number of countries, including the closest allies of the US.\n\nIn May, President Trump tightened US sanctions on Iran - mainly targeting its oil sector. Iran then announced it would suspend some commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter?\n\nIn recent months, the US has strengthened its forces in the Gulf - saying there was a danger of Iranian attacks. It sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the region.\n\nIn response, Iran accused the US of aggressive behaviour. Those tensions rose markedly after the 12 May limpet mine attacks in the UAE.\n\nThe UAE blamed an unnamed \"state actor\". The US said that actor was Iran, an accusation Tehran denied.\n\nWhile it is unclear why Iran would carry out a relatively low-level attack on the multinational tankers, observers have speculated that it could have been to send a signal to forces ranged against it that it is capable of disrupting shipping there without triggering a war.",
