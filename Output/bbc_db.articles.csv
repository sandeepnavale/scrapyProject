The Hong Kong government has suspended its highly controversial plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced.

She had previously refused to scrap the bill despite mass protests from Hong Kong residents.

""I feel deep sorrow and regret that deficiencies in our work – and various other factors – have stirred up substantial controversies,"" she said.

Protesters expressed concern at increased Chinese influence.

Ms Lam said she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"".

She also admitted that the ""explanation and communication"" of the bill had not been adequate.

She said her goal was ""the greatest interests of Hong Kong"", which involved first restoring peace and order.

The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan.

Ms Lam said that the urgency felt to pass the bill before the legislative year ends ""perhaps no longer exists"".

No date has been set for ""the next step forward"", she said.

Hundreds of thousands of people have protested against the bill and further demonstrations were planned for Sunday.

Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence.

Protest leaders said that despite Ms Lam's announcement, they would continue their demonstrations until the bill was cancelled, not just delayed.

'Striking U-turn'

Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong

It was a striking U-turn from a leader who previously struck a defiant tone.

Mere days ago, Ms Lam had vowed to press ahead with the unpopular legislation – now she has promised to ""listen to different views from society"".

But for many protesters, the damage has already been done, and the move to delay - but not cancel - the legislation is unlikely to assuage their concerns.

One protester told me he believed the government was ""trying to divert attention away until opposition calms down - and then they'll try to re-do the whole process again"".

Others said they would still take part in a march against the proposal planned for Sunday.

""Our final goal is to cancel the law, not to pause it. I think there will still be many people coming out tomorrow,"" a student leader told me.

Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy.

China's foreign ministry publicly backed Ms Lam after her announcement.

""The Chinese Central Government expresses its support, respect and understanding for the [Hong Kong] government's decision,"" spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement.

Amid the international debate on Hong Kong, he also warned that its ""affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no interference from any country, organization or individual"".

What was the controversy about?

The changes would allow for criminal extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau - decided on a case-by-case basis by Hong Kong courts.

It comes after a high-profile case where a Hong Kong man was accused of murdering his girlfriend on holiday in Taiwan but could not be extradited.

Hong Kong officials, including Ms Lam, say the bill is necessary to protect the city against criminals.

But many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state.

Opposition activists also cite the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions and forced confessions in mainland China.

How did protests unfold?

A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday.

Then on Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill.

Tensions boiled over and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested.

The police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets, have been accused of excessive force by some rights groups.

Is Hong Kong part of China?

Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War - which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China. It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997.

It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system.

It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region.

But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs.

Why are people angry about the plan?

People in Hong Kong are worried that the extradition bill could bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control.

Hong Kong officials had said its courts would have the final say whether to grant extradition requests.

Ms Lam's government had also said suspects accused of political and religious crimes would not be extradited, insisting legally binding human rights safeguards would also be in place."," ",15 June 2019,Hong Kong extradition protests: Government suspends bill,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-48645342

The US assistant secretary of state for Africa, Tibor Nagy, has called for a credible and independent investigation into the killing of dozens of protesters by security forces in Sudan last week, calling it ""critically important"".

There has been international condemnation of Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC), which decided last week to scrap all existing agreements with the main opposition coalition and announced plans to hold elections within nine months.

Before that point, the military and protesters agreed a three-year transition period to civilian rule.

On Thursday, Mr Nagy met senior members of the TMC for talks in the capital, Khartoum.

He described the discussions ""as frank [and] as direct as possible, and obviously we didn’t agree on some points"".

Speaking to reporters in the Ethiopian capital on Friday, he said the US wants to see a civilian government acceptable to the Sudanese people at the end of the transitional period.

A third-party negitiator would help to break the deadlock between the military council and the opposition, Mr Nagy said.

He applauded efforts by the African Union and Ethiopia's prime minister to broker a deal, but added that ""all tools are available and remain on the table""."," ",,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world/africa

Bartering is one of the oldest ways of doing business in the world.

The exchange of goods and services predates the use of money and is believed to have developed in the first human societies. Today, bartering is usually associated with countries in turmoil.

Take fisherman in Venezuela who now swap their catch for other food stuffs or medicines, because after years of hyperinflation the country's currency is now nearly worthless.

Or the bartering networks that emerged in Greece at the height of its financial crisis eight or so years ago.

However, it is not just individuals who continue to engage in bartering, it is also used by governments. And again, this is often the case when a country is facing financial woes and isolation on the world stage, such as Venezuela or Iran.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Iran has been swapping its oil for Indian rice - a key foodstuff for Iranians

For both countries bartering has enabled them to get around US-led economic blockades.

Bartering also continues to occasionally be used by companies, such as Indonesian aircraft maker Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) agreeing to trade two of its transport aircraft for 110,000 tonnes of Thai sticky rice back in 1996. That was all the Thai buyer had to offer.

And in an even more eye-opening historic example, back in the 1970s US giant Pepsi traded its soft drink for Soviet tomato paste, so it could enter the USSR market. Pepsi, which owned Pizza Hut at the time, spread the tomato paste across its pizzas in western Europe. It also bartered its fizzy drink for Russian vodka, and even Soviet warships, which it sold on for scrap.

Swedish chart-toppers Abba did something similar in the Soviet Union, where they earned royalties in the form of fruit, vegetables and crude oil, which were then sold on the global market.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Venezuela and Cuba's close ties were put in place by Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro

Back in Iran, it has used bartering to support its economy ever since the US first imposed sanctions after the Iranian revolution of 1979. The Iranians then had to start bartering even more when tough curbs were imposed by the United Nations between 2010 and 2015.

With the UN sanctions making it impossible for Iran to buy goods on the international markets with its own currency, Tehran started offering crude oil, and gold held in vaults abroad, in exchange for basic staples like rice, cooking oil and tea.

After the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, the UK, the US - as well as Germany and the European Union, Iran was able to start trading normally again.

But last year President Trump pulled the US out of the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and re-imposed sanctions. This has forced Iran to return to bartering, such as reviving its old agreement with India, whereby it exchanges its oil for rice.

Using a method that is bit more complicated than a straight swap, Iran agrees to accept payment for its oil in Indian rupees. The money is paid into an Indian bank account operated by an Indian state-owned bank.

Iran then uses this to pay for rice and other Indian imports such as pharmaceuticals, with no money crossing banks or borders. It's a moot point whether this bartering violates sanctions or not, but until the US removed special waivers for Iran's main oil importers, it had become a common way to do business.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Venezuela swaps oil for Cuban workers

France, Germany and the UK set up a similar scheme earlier this year to allow companies in their countries to trade with Iran. The initiative is called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchange, and it is limited to humanitarian goods, such as medicines and food items.

In Venezuela, it is not just goods that are bartered - it can be workers too. It sends 50,000 barrels of oil every day to Cuba. In return Cuba sends its highly trained doctors, teachers and economic advisors to work in Venezuela.

Most barter deals are struck when conventional avenues are blocked. says Michael Czinkota, an associate professor of international business at Georgetown University in Washington.

He says this is also the case for other trade deals that are not straight cash payments, which are known collectively as ""countertrades"". These can include a simple mix of barter and money, to pledges of future investment or purchases.

""The starting point for countertrades is always that something is wrong with the traditional system,"" he says. ""The companies I talk to who do countertrade say if they could do everything they do for money that would always be their first preference.""

Meanwhile, Shirley Mustafa, an economist at the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation, says such deals became more common after the 2008 financial crisis.

""Some countries lost confidence in the international trading system [so they took action],"" she says.

Trading goods for other goods or services also helps governments to save precious foreign currency reserves. For this reason some countries actively seek barter or other countertrade deals, says Lindsey Shanson, editor of Countertrade and Offset magazine.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

One such nation is Malaysia, which back in the 1990s swapped some of its abundant palm oil crop for Russian fighter aircraft. Earlier this year, it proposed doing the same thing again as it wants to modernise its defence forces, but has little spare cash.

Regarding the decision of Indonesian aircraft mater IPTN to accept Thai sticky rice as payment, economist Travis Taylor says the company simply wanted to get a deal done.

Image caption Abba were sellers of crude oil

""In that case it was really about building reputational capital [in a new market],"" says Mr Taylor, who is an associate professor of economics at Christopher Newport University in Virginia.

""No-one wants to be stuck with tonnes of sticky rice. But this company also wanted evidence that the aircraft could be sold. So they couldn't be picky.""

Prof Taylor adds that a specific type of countertrade deal called ""offset agreements"" continue to be prevalent in the global defence sector. Under these agreements defence firms agree to generate economic activity within a country over a period of time, such as buying or making components there.

Overall, he says that bartering and the other types of countertrade are here to stay, ""particularly among developing countries and during times of instability"".",Szu Ping Chan,13 June 2019,When Pepsi was swapped for Soviet warships,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48343589
5d04dce9ad0d019b7c5b4705,"Image copyright National Oceanography Centre Image caption The Boaty McBoatface autonomous underwater vehicle is designed to run on low power

From arctic wastes to fiery volcanoes, ocean depths to distant planets, a new generation of rugged drones is going to places humans can't. But how do you make a super-tough drone?

When it sets off on its arctic explorations, the Royal Research Ship (RSS) David Attenborough will be carrying within it a full complement of autonomous flying and submersible vehicles designed to lay bare the mysteries of the polar regions.

One underwater drone or AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) that may be aboard come launch day bears the name Boaty McBoatface, the quirky moniker chosen for its mother ship in an online poll which was subsequently overruled.

Boaty is designed to dive to 6,000m (19,700 ft) where the pressure is about 600 times greater than at sea level. Less rugged vehicles would be crushed completely at those depths.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Attenborough launches 'Boaty McBoatface' polar ship

It comes equipped with a payload of sensors, imaging equipment, sonar, hydrophones and communications kit to gather data on changing deep ocean temperatures and their potential impact on climate change.

One of the toughest challenges its National Oceanography Centre designers faced was being able to build a craft that could travel long distances under the ice without needing to recharge.

Recent advances in microprocessors, much of it driven by smartphone technology, has helped change that by reducing the amount of power these drones need to run.

""The vehicle is designed to draw a very small amount of power for its propulsion systems,"" explains Dr Maaten Furlong, head of marine autonomous and robotics systems at the National Oceanography Centre.

""As a result it travels at a relatively slow speed, which in turn enables it to cover huge distances and carry out extended missions compared to vehicles that have gone before.""

Early last year, Boaty - or the Autosub Long Range (ALR) to give it its proper name - completed its first full under-ice expedition at the Filchner Ice Shelf in West Antarctica, where it spent a total of 51 hours under the Antarctic ice, travelling 108km (67 miles).

More Technology of Business

It reached depths of 944m, at one time travelling under a section of ice shelf 550m thick. GPS signals can't penetrate so far down, so navigation is tricky.

Instead, it has to use dead reckoning. By using a point of origin - such as the mother ship - it estimates the direction and distance travelled, calculating speed by bouncing sound off the seabed and measuring the echoes.

Its fibre-optic gyro-based sensor has an error rate of 0.1%, which means for every kilometre travelled it could drift one metre off course, the designers say.

But to explore even further and deeper, new navigation tech will be required. And this is under development.

Called Terrain Aided Navigation, this system essentially maps the sea floor, and these maps are loaded in to the vehicle's computer. Ultimately, the designers hope the robots will be able to ""see"" well enough to create their own maps in real time.

""A long-term ambition for the ALR family of vehicles is to deliver on the potential and the ambition to complete a full trans-Arctic mission under ice, an environment about which we know very little at this point.

""This will require the new Terrain Aided Navigation techniques being developed to be fully operational.""

Arctic sub-sea conditions are pretty tough, but the surface of planet Mars is even tougher, bringing with it a whole new set of design challenges.

Two devices being developed by Nasa to survey the volcanic bowels of the red planet are currently being trialled on Earth, with their designers envisaging uses much closer to home.

Lemur - short for Limbed Excursion Mechanical Utility Robot - is a four-limbed machine that can scale rock walls, gripping with hundreds of tiny hooks in each of its 16 fingers. Engineers from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Labs took Lemur on a field test in California's Death Valley in January, where it used artificial intelligence to choose a route up a cliff.

Nasa's Dr Aaron Parness says Lemur's rock-climbing abilities could be used for search and rescue operations to help disaster relief teams.

Finding claws that wouldn't wear down on the rock was a challenge.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lava rock can be very abrasive and difficult to traverse for humans... and robots

""We looked at titanium, steel, carbon fibre, carbide, tool steel,"" says Dr Parness. ""We tried sewing needles to sail boat needles, syringes, lathe tools, even harvesting cactus spines.""

The winning solution? Fishing hooks.

""Turns out that industry is really good at making things sharp, strong, and durable,"" he says.

Nasa's other tough robot is Volcanobot, a relatively low-cost device designed to be lowered in to fissures and survive extreme heat.

On a trial mission to the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii, it mapped the conduits of previous eruptions to get an understanding of how that style of volcano works underground.

But building machines that can navigate over harsh terrain as well as deal with extreme temperatures has proven tough.

Volcanic rock ""is extremely sharp and hard,"" explains Dr Parness. ""If you walk a mile of two across a lava flow, the soles of your shoes will be 100% trashed.""

So Volcanotbot uses carbon-fibre infused material in its 3D-printed parts to make them stronger and more resistant to abrasion.

""It gets scratched up like crazy, but protects the electronics inside,"" he says.

While the team has created casings and materials that can withstand 300C, the weak link is the electronics inside, which ""tend to fail around 60-80C"".

""It didn't help to have a strong robot shell protecting dead robot guts!""

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan has developed a team of automated firefighting robots designed to cope with extreme heat.

Equipped with GPS and laser sensors to help them navigate to the scene of the fire, a water cannon robot takes up a position then the hose extension drone drives to the water source, laying out hose along the ground.

The water cannon can then unleash its payload, squirting up to 4,000 litres per minute.

The system was put through its first trial in March at Tokyo's National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster, with its designers envisaging their use in highly volatile environments such as petro-chemical blazes.

A spokesman for the design team said the aim is for the robots to fully-autonomous in time.

Robotics expert Prof Barry Lennox says that reduced construction costs, better materials and improved sensors are driving the development of tough drones around the world.

Through building-block activities, the children are introduced to social skills and communication techniques.

We spent the day looking at the work of Amy and her team.

Mentor Caryn sets the scene with toy sharks on a blue mat. It's shark-infested water. The challenge is to get across, unharmed.

""I'm a building machine, I can build anything,"" says Oliver after he tells everyone about the Lego mechanism he has designed.

He has built a speedboat with not one, but three ""distracter blasters"".

One will launch fish at the sharks, the second is a net which will capture the sharks too busy feasting to notice and finally - as they sail safely past - a special serum will destroy the net and release the sharks back into the wild.

Image caption Amy, Jordan and Oliver sit and listen to Caryn's instructions

This is the first time Amy, Jordan and Oliver have been on board the Block Bus and to them it seems like a play centre on wheels.

Containers full of different types of building blocks tower above them. Cuddly toys are placed on the sofa and Jordan grabs a monkey which he nestles next to him. Sensory lights create a calm mood - this is a safe and inviting space.

The children get comfortable on the mat. Caryn's instruction is to build a tower.

""Same instruction, different models. We all think a little bit differently and that's OK,"" Caryn says, as all three get to work and create something completely different.

The organisation which runs the Block Bus, Alpha Inclusion, uses Lego therapy and building blocks to help children between the ages of five and 16 improve their social communication, interaction and personal effectiveness. They provide small group sessions as well as working with individuals.

Originally an American invention, Lego therapy was created to help children with autism and learning difficulties to develop their communication skills, but it is now used more widely.

The Block Bus travels about and can park up to create an accessible environment for all.

Currently covering East Anglia, Alpha Inclusion works with about a dozen schools regularly, and has worked with many more to train staff to work with children. The Block Bus also visits local events and festivals.

Founder Amy Eleftheriades has worked in this field for more than 20 years.

""Over the years I have found that Lego can be tricky for some children and they need to start on a more basic level,"" she says.

""Some children can't necessarily manipulate the Lego and so we find out their interests, and use that to engage with them. We might use arts, clay or play. It depends on the child.""

Alpha Inclusion has been working with St Michael's voluntarily aided junior school for more than a year. They work closely to understand the needs of the individual child, and train teaching assistants to enable them to reproduce the work they do.

""Underlying everything we do is children's mental health and wellbeing,"" says Mrs Helen McCarney, who has been head teacher at the school for 15 years. ""If you cannot tackle that they cannot learn.""

Lego therapy is an accessible mechanism for intervention and it isn't used just for autism.

Mrs McCarney explains that activities with Lego help the children open up and talk about their problems. These interventions also help some children engage with the wider curriculum.

Alpha Inclusion also works with children who are close to exclusion, re-engaging them and improving their home-school relationships.

""It's really powerful,"" says Mrs Kath Brabbin, the school's Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO).

""We had a girl last year who was refused by another school, but with the help of Amy and Caryn she is now in school and attending lessons.""

Image caption Mrs Brabbin and Head Teacher Mrs McCarney

""We work with the needs rather than the label,"" Amy says. ""People believe in us, and it's meant that they have gone above and beyond.""

The Block Bus doesn't just help children. Amy and her team also use it for corporate work including team-building activities, wellbeing sessions, communication skills, development training and autism awareness.

Profits generated are reinvested to assist in delivering services for education, health and social care.

Back in the bus Caryn asks the children to build something with four pieces and then pass it on. Oliver places his four pieces down and passes it to Jordan. He watches on, but seems concerned to see the structure change.

Caryn notices and asks: ""Are you OK Oliver, you seem a bit upset by how Jordan has changed the barn?"" Oliver takes a moment to think before he replies: ""I'm OK with it because we are all putting our ideas together.""

""Sometimes children don't like to go out of class, and be seen to be different. So if you can say to them 'we are going to go and do something with Lego', it feels like play. It's not like doing work,"" says Mrs Brabbin.

""It's like a lesson outside. The children turn around and say 'we didn't have class today'.""

For Amy this is just the beginning.

""This is our first year and we are still learning,"" she says. ""But in my head we have a whole fleet of double-decker buses.""

Mangroves cover 13,989 sq km of Brazil's coast and are an important protection against climate change, with one acre of mangrove forest absorbing nearly the same amount of carbon dioxide as an acre of Amazon rainforest.

The forests also protect the coast from eroding as intense storms grow more frequent.

According to climate researcher Carlos Nobre, at the University of Sao Paulo, water levels have risen 20-30cm (1ft) over the past 100 years in coastal Bahia state, where Cairu is located.

A battery-powered radio has given Mr Da Cruz a link to the rest of the world and enabled him to learn about the science of climate change.

Scientists predict the global surface temperature will have risen by more than 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels, by the end of the 21st Century.

And some prediction models in a 2014 report by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) say this temperature increase will actually exceed 2C, without unprecedented changes within human societies.

Biologist Renato de Almeida, from the nearby Federal University of Reconcavo da Bahia, says overfishing is also a likely cause for the decline in crab and fish populations.

Mr Da Cruz and his wife, Vandeka, harvest oysters as well as crabs from the mangrove forest.

Other factors that affect fishing include growing tourism, leading to the clearing of mangroves to build inns and piers for visitors.

An increase in water traffic can disrupt oysters on riverbanks and erode the attachment of mangroves to the soil.

The photographer had been visiting Greenland for several years before deciding to document community life in 2019, starting with Upernavik village.

Mr Chu recalls the moment he arrived: ""I could only see a pure white land covered by ice and snow during my entire flight. But I suddenly saw a big, warm dot in [the] far distance—it was Upernavik.

""The beauty of this tranquil village was really beyond my imagination. It was a wow moment for me.""

Upernavik has a population of around 1,000 people, the 13th largest village in the country. Mr Chu spent six days scouting the village for photo opportunities when he came across the scene above, featuring a family walking under the street lights.

""It felt so harmonious. The whole land was covered by white, cold snow, and the blue tint at dusk made it even cooler.""

Mr Chu's photo was selected as the overall winner from the Cities category. Here are other winners, with descriptions by the photographers.

Andrew Crosby has 7,000 emails in his inbox. To some that might not sound like many, but he's only been at Relax Gaming for a year, so there's not been much time for the inbox to get out of control.

As a senior executive at the software company, which has eight offices around Europe, he fields around 140 emails a day.

""You have to pick and choose what you think is going to be relevant to yourself... you can get cc'ed into so many emails that are nothing to do with yourself whatsoever,"" he says.

And there's the key problem with email. The message that might contain the single most important thing you need to know all year, could well disappear into the landfill that is your inbox.

Email malaise

It's not just inefficient, it's also bad for your health.

Image caption Many of our inboxes are crowded with emails we will probably never read again

""Email overload is causing people to get ill,"" says Cary Cooper, organisational psychology professor at Manchester University.

His research has found that higher email load is associated with higher workload stress.

""The problem is there aren't good guidelines on what is the best use of email and the things we should not do,"" he says.

""We cc in everybody rather than just the one or two people we should be interacting with. Line managers should never send emails outside of office hours to their subordinates unless it's absolutely essential.

""There's no point in sending someone an email on a Friday night saying you don't have to deal with this until Monday, because people will then worry about it and do it that weekend.""

But he is not saying that email should be eliminated altogether.

""It's a great way to keep in touch with people, particularly who are remote. It's a great way to send data, to send information. By itself it's fine - it's the way people are using it is the problem,"" says Prof Cooper.

Enforced breaks

France has tried to improve the situation. In 2017, a law was introduced that obliged firms to come up with a plan to ensure staff get a break from office emails. In August 2018, the French arm of Britain's Rentokil Initial was ruled to have broken that law and was ordered to pay an employee €60,000 (£53,000).

No such rules exist here in the UK, but some firms have taken action anyway.

Platypus Digital is a marketing agency which runs fundraising campaigns for charities. From the very start, in 2014, its founders banned internal emails and any staff who forget have to donate £5 to charity.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One solution is ""inbox zero"" - rigorously dealing with all emails as they come in each day

""We'd all worked in charities and companies that had been around a lot longer and experienced that internal email overload, where the majority of your day is trawling through internal updates that you don't need to be a part of,"" says managing director Matt Collins.

Instead, the company's seven employees use a messaging service and documents software from Google, and a project management system from Asana.

""We decided to use tools that were much more effective and much more fun,"" Mr Collins adds.

Inbox zero

But what if you work in a much larger organisation, where you have to use email to get anything done?

Clare Godson is a senior lawyer and executive director at global legal subscription business Aosphere. Six months ago she decided to try ""inbox zero"" and has been ""evangelical"" about it ever since. The idea is to manage your inbox strictly, ideally not having anything there at all.

Image copyright Clare Godson Image caption Lawyer Clare Godson is evangelical about achieving 'inbox zero'

There's lots of advice about how to do it on the internet, but broadly you have to do something with every email you receive.

""It's completely revolutionised the way I feel about my email,"" she says. ""I never have that feeling any more that there's something lurking in there that I've forgotten to deal with.

""It's massively satisfying as a way of working, it just makes me feel more efficient and I think I feel lighter mentally.""

She accepts that for many people it's a big hurdle.

""Most people are incredulous that you could possibly get there. They think you must be constantly in your inbox checking, deleting and sorting, which isn't true.""

People also think she can't be that busy, which she also rejects: ""The busier you are, the more you need to be rigorous and organised.""

Slack attack

Let's face it, for most office workers, inbox zero is never going to happen.

Whoever who can solve this communication problem ""will be the most important software company in the world"". That's according to Slack, a US company which sells a service that allows staff to message each other and co-operate on projects.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Slack hopes to become 'the most important software company in the world'

Its founders, frustrated with email, launched Slack in 2014 and, according to the firm, more than 600,000 organisations use the service.

On Slack, communications are based on groups of users rather than individual inboxes. Despite losing $420m in three years, it plans to list on the stock market later this month.

Andrew Crosby of Relax Gaming uses Slack and likes it, although it has not stopped him accumulating 7,000 emails in his inbox.

More Technology of Business

Other firms are also trying to exploit frustration with emails, including Microsoft, which Slack identifies as its biggest rival. Microsoft Teams was launched in 2017 and the company says that more than 500,000 firms use the service.

Facebook also offers a collaboration tool called Workplace.

The secret?

While many people rave about such services, they don't appear to be a complete replacement for email. It is still the best way to communicate with people outside your organisation.

The trick, according to Mr Collins, is to be strict about how you use it. He attaches a document to all his emails explaining his personal policy, which warns correspondents that his emails will be brief and, unless they are a current client, they should not expect a quick reply.

He says lots of people read his personal policy and like it. And it seems to be working. When I speak to him he has just 20 emails in his inbox. If all this seems a bit too much effort, then perhaps you should consider inbox infinity.

The idea is to let the emails pile up, embrace the chaos and thus liberate yourself from the guilt and anxiety. Just make sure you don't miss the message from the boss about your pay rise.",Ben Morris,11 June 2019,How to cope with email overload,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48271940

The Aarey forest, a verdant strip that lies at the heart of India's bustling Mumbai city, is often referred to as its last green lung. But now, locals say, it's under threat from encroachment. BBC Marathi's Janhavee Moole reports.

As a child, Stalin Dayanand used to picnic in the Aarey forest.

""It was the only place where you could go and play, climb trees or just sit and eat under the shade of a tree and be close to nature,"" says Stalin, who prefers to go by his first name.

Now the 54-year-old is the director of an NGO that works to protect forests and wetlands. He is fighting for Aarey.

On 6 June, the government cleared 40 hectares (99 acres) of the 1,300 hectare forest to build a zoo, complete with a night safari.

Another slice of it is being claimed by Mumbai's new metro rail which is currently under construction. Thousands of trees will have to be felled to construct a new multi-level parking unit for the metro.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What happens if you ban plastic?

Stalin has petitioned India's Supreme Court challenging the construction, but the case is still pending.

Locals and environmental activists like him are up in arms because they fear the government will eventually clear the way for private builders to encroach on the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which lies to the north of Aarey. Spread over 104 sq km (40 sq miles), this protected area makes Mumbai one of the rare cities to have a jungle within its boundaries.

Their concern is partly fuelled by the fact that this is prime location in a city where land is scarce and real estate prices are among the most expensive in the world.

But officials dismiss these fears as unfounded and point out that the construction for the metro only requires 30 hectares of the 1,300 hectares that make up the Aarey forest.

""This is the most suitable land due to its size, shape and location,"" says Ashwini Bhide, managing director of the Mumbai metro rail corporation.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Plans to fell trees in the forest have led to protests

She adds that the city badly needs a ""mass rapid transport system"". India's financial hub is congested and infamous for its crawling traffic jams and its local train system heavily overburdened.

Officials say that the metro will eventually carry around 1.7 million passengers every day and bring down the number of vehicles on the road by up to 650,000. The city's current colonial-era railway system, which is effectively its lifeline, ferries some 7.5 million people between Mumbai's suburbs and its heart on a daily basis.

But they have been up against the city's residents, including activists and conservationists, ever since news emerged in 2014 that trees would be cut to make way for the metro.

What makes the issue complicated is that the Aarey forest is the site of competing claims.

It's locally known as the Aarey ""milk colony"" because most of the land was given to the department of dairy development in 1951. But they are allowed to grow cattle fodder only on a fraction of the land. The rest of it is densely forested and dotted with lakes, and the Mithi river flows through it.

Aarey is also home to tribal communities who live in settlements known as ""padas"".

""We are not getting basic facilities here, and now metro authorities want to take away the jungle which belongs to us too,"" says Asha Bhoye, who belongs to the Konkani tribe and lives in one of the 29 padas. Plans to relocate some of the tribal communities have also met with resistance and led to protests.

Stalin alleges that instead of declaring the Aarey forest a protected area, the state government has used the opportunity to parcel away pieces of it first to the dairy development department and now to other projects.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tribals who live in Aarey demand that it be declared a protected area

""Aarey Forest is part of the same forest as Sanjay Gandhi National Park and we are fighting for the national park itself. In the name of public good, the land is being opened up for developers. It's a systematic effort to destroy the forest.""

Activists fear that after the parking units are built, other projects will be permitted, further threatening the area's ecology and wildlife, which includes leopards.

So locals have joined the fight enthusiastically, even leading hikes into the forest to raise awareness. ""We bring people here, make them familiar with the forest - there are many species of spiders like trapdoor spiders, the site [of the parking unit] is a leopard site,"" says Yash Marwa, a screenwriter who is among those campaigning for the forest.

""Mumbai needs to be liveable"", he adds. ""We need to talk about good quality of air and life before talking about infrastructure and development.""

Stalin agrees, saying that ""air quality and temperature seem to be last among people's priorities.""

But he is determined to not give up.

Genome sequencing is set to revolutionise the diagnosis of rare childhood conditions, according to researchers in Cambridge.

All seriously ill children in England with an unexplained disorder will be eligible for genome analysis, which involves mapping a person's entire genetic code, from next year.

It follows a project at Addenbrooke's Hospital and Cambridge university.

One in four children in intensive care had a genetic disorder, it found.

Researchers were able to give a diagnosis within two to three weeks, which sometimes led to a change in treatment or spared children further invasive tests.

In each case, the whole genome of the child and both their parents were sequenced, which showed whether a gene fault had been passed on.

'Fast meaningful result'

So far, about 350 babies and children in intensive care at Addenbrooke's Hospital have had their genome, made up of billions of letters of DNA code, analysed as part of the Next Generation Children research project.

In two-thirds of cases, the gene error had occurred spontaneously at conception rather than being inherited.

The children had a range of conditions - including birth abnormalities, neurological symptoms including epilepsy, metabolic diseases or reduced growth.

Lucy Raymond, professor of medical genetics and neurodevelopment at the University of Cambridge, who led the project, said: ""It is astonishing to be able to give a meaningful result from whole genome sequencing analysis in just a couple of weeks, compared to earlier in my career, when we spent years simply trying to locate a single gene.""

One surprising finding was that a child's appearance and clinical symptoms alone were rarely a good predictor of whether they had a genetic condition.

Image copyright Picken family Image caption Seren was born with an incredibly rare gene disorder

Prof Raymond said the project would be used as a template by the NHS Genomic Medicine Service and rolled out across England in 2020.

This will mean that any baby or child in England admitted to intensive care with an unexplained condition will be eligible, together with their parents, for whole genome sequencing - the first national health service in the world to offer this.

So what will it mean for families?

First, a more rapid diagnosis. That was the case for Claire Cole and Kris Daly, parents of Millie-Mae, aged two, who has a rare form of epilepsy.

They were offered whole genome sequencing last year, after Millie-Mae had been repeatedly admitted to hospital with uncontrolled seizures.

Claire told BBC News: ""We were given the result when she was in intensive care, and they immediately changed one of her medications which was aggravating for her type of epilepsy.

Image copyright Fergus Walsh Image caption Millie-Mae and her parents, Claire and Kris, had their genomes sequenced

""We saw a big difference as soon as that change was made,"" she said.

Kris added: ""The test result came amazingly quickly and was priceless, because it allowed us to put all the correct people in place and do the best for her.""

Claire and Kris, from Suffolk, who have three other older children, were told that Millie-Mae's condition was the result of a spontaneous mutation rather than being passed on from them.

Claire said: ""Millie-Mae has Dravet syndrome, which is a serious condition, so it was a difficult thing to be told, but I'm glad we have a diagnosis now, as not knowing would be very hard.""

Millie-Mae has a mutation in the SCN1A gene and routine genetic testing would have eventually revealed this.

But Prof Raymond said this would have taken many more months, and with other conditions it could take years for families to get a diagnosis.

She said: ""Parents will no longer have to suffer an agonising diagnostic odyssey of going to different specialists repeating their story and we can use that time focused on the care of the child.""

The move to whole genome analysis has become possible because of the dramatic increase in the speed of sequencing, and the fall in price.

It costs less than £1,000 to sequence a genome but Prof Raymond said this could eventually save the NHS money through avoiding repeated diagnostic tests when trying to find the cause of a rare disorder, which could previously take many years.

How else could whole genome sequencing help families?

In the case of Katie and Ian Picken, from Essex, it explained why their baby daughter, Seren, died, and gave them certainty that their son, Rhys, was unaffected.

Seren was born in September 2017, apparently healthy, but within a few weeks she began to have seizures and was admitted to intensive care. Her condition deteriorated and she died at 13 weeks.

Seren and her parents had had blood samples taken, which were sent for whole genome sequencing. The samples confirmed that she had a fatal mitochondrial disorder, but its cause could not be pinpointed because no variants were found in any genes known to cause disease.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Katie Picken says genome sequencing helped bring closure after their first baby died, and gave hope for the future

Prof Raymond and her team had found two variants in a previously unreported gene, NDUFA6, and that Seren had inherited one from each parent, but the role of the gene was unclear.

In May 2018, Katie and Ian contacted Addenbrooke's to tell them that she was pregnant, and this prompted an urgent reanalysis of their genomes to establish whether the couple were at risk of passing on a fatal disorder.

Using GeneMatcher, Prof Raymond uploaded the gene variants on to a global database and found three other children with the same incredibly rare condition, which affects mitochondrial function.

A research paper was published within weeks, recording the first cases of the disorder - which was essential because the NHS can only offer prenatal testing for a gene if it has been published in medical literature.

Katie had chorionic villus sampling at 15 weeks, where a small sample of cells is removed from the placenta.

Both parents had passed on a faulty copy of the NDUFA6 gene to Seren, so it meant there was a one in four chance they would pass on the fatal disorder to their unborn son.

There then followed an anxious few days waiting for the results before they got a call from Prof Raymond saying the pregnancy was unaffected.

Ian said: ""It was a hugely emotional moment; we sat and cried with happiness, and with sadness because of what we had gone through with Seren.""

The couple's son, Rhys, was born in December 2018, a year after the death of his sister, and is completely healthy.

""Genomics has the potential to transform the delivery of care for patients which is why the NHS has prioritised it in its Long Term Plan,"" said Prof Dame Sue Hill, chief scientific officer of NHS England.

""This Cambridge trial is important because not only does it show the potential benefits of whole genome sequencing to significantly improve care for seriously ill children, but it also demonstrates this technology can be delivered as part of a mainstream NHS service.""

Almost 600 plant species have been lost from the wild in the last 250 years, according to a comprehensive study.

The number is based on actual extinctions rather than estimates, and is twice that of all bird, mammal and amphibian extinctions combined.

Scientists say plant extinction is occurring up to 500 times faster than what would be expected naturally.

In May, a UN report estimated that one million animal and plant species were threatened with extinction.

Researchers say their analysis of all documented plant extinctions in the world shows what lessons can be learned to stop future extinctions.

Most people can name a mammal or bird that has become extinct in recent centuries, but few could name an extinct plant, said Dr Aelys Humphreys of Stockholm University.

""This study is the first time we have an overview of what plants have already become extinct, where they have disappeared from and how quickly this is happening,"" she added.

Image copyright Rebecca Cairn Wicks Image caption St Helena Olive: The tree went extinct in 2003

The lost plants include the Chile sandalwood, which was exploited for essential oils, the banded trinity plant, which spent much of its life underground, and the pink-flowered St Helena olive tree.

The biggest losses are on islands and in the tropics, which are home to highly valued timber trees and tend to be particularly rich in plant diversity.

What did the study find?

Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Stockholm University found that 571 plant species had disappeared in the last two and a half centuries, a number that is more than twice the number of birds, mammals and amphibians recorded as extinct (a combined total of 217 species).

This data suggests plant extinction is happening as much as 500 times faster than what would be expected normally, if humans weren't around.

The researchers believe even these numbers underestimate the true levels of ongoing plant extinction.

One positive, though, was evidence that some plants once thought extinct have been rediscovered, such as the Chilean crocus.

Image copyright Richard Wilford Image caption The Chilean crocus: Rediscovered in 2001 after years of searching

Why does plant extinction matter?

All life on Earth depends on plants, which provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat.

Plant extinctions can lead to a whole cascade of extinctions in other organisms that rely on them, for instance insects that use plants for food and for laying their eggs.

""Millions of other species depend on plants for their survival, humans included, so knowing which plants we are losing and from where, will feed back into conservation programmes targeting other organisms as well,"" she explained.

What lessons can we learn?

The researchers are calling for a number of measures to stop plant extinction:

Record all the plants across the world

Support herbaria, which preserve plant specimens for posterity

Support botanists who carry out vital research

Teach our children to see and recognise local plants.

Dr Rob Salguero-Gómez, of the University of Oxford, who was not part of the study, said understanding the how, where, and why of plant loss was of paramount importance, not only for ecologists but also for human societies.

""We depend on plants directly for food, shade and construction materials, and indirectly for 'ecosystem services' such as carbon fixation, oxygen creation, and even improvement in human mental health through enjoying green spaces,"" he commented.

The research is published in the journal, Nature Ecology and Evolution.

Since then, America's heartland has had little reprieve from rain. May was the second-wettest month in recorded US history.

In addition to rain, the thunderstorms brought a slew of tornados - over 500 in May alone, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service (NWS).

And all the while, rivers and lakes continued to fill and crest, breaking years of records, pouring over levees and barriers, covering highways, bridges and towns. There have been over 35 flood-related deaths in the region so far, according to NWS.

""The US is split in two for hundreds of miles,"" says Mr Hurst, who is the president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, describing the water's sprawl from north of Omaha, Nebraska, down past St Louis, Missouri.

As of 10 June, around 200 river gauges along the Mississippi, Missouri and Arkansas rivers are still reporting flood levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

""We've seen more flooding in the past decade than we've seen in the decades before. This has gone past that into something historic.""

Environmental scientist Prof Samuel Munoz of Northeastern University also says 2019 will make the history books.

It's ""unusual"" for the Great Plains and Midwest, he notes, to see this number of repeated strong storms and severe weather in one spring.

Part of that could be because of El Niño - a natural weather event that brings unusually warm sea-surface temperatures to the Pacific.

""El Niño conditions tend to enhance precipitation and severe weather over the areas that are flooding,"" Prof Munoz explains.

""Manmade climate change intensifies these natural variations, causing more rain to fall in what would already have been a wet year.""

More on climate change

Keith Hillman, director of the emergency management team in Vilonia, Arkansas, says his city has seen over 4.5ft [1.4m] of rain since January.

""It's well above the normal rainfall this year and anytime you have that much rain, it's gotta go somewhere eventually.

""I've been told by our county judge that they think the river won't be at normal stages until the end of July.""

When I spoke to Mr Hillman last week, his team was preparing for nearby Lake Conway to flood. At one point, officials said the water levels in the lake's reservoir were rising a foot per hour.

""It's hard to control Mother Nature,"" Mr Hillman told me, resigned. ""This is just our time.""

But the way these major rivers are managed could also be contributing to these historic floods.

The Mississippi River system contains an elaborate network of dams, levees and spillways, run by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Prof Munoz says.

""These management efforts have straightened, steepened, and narrowed the river, and our research has shown that these changes cause floodwaters to flow higher and faster.""

Such structures are undoubtedly needed from an economic standpoint, but Prof Munoz says the problem lies in the fact that these systems were designed for a mid-20th Century climate.

""As the climate continues to change, we need to have a conversation nationally and globally about how we are going to live and work in low-lying areas,"" he says. ""If we ignore this problem, our water management systems will continue to be overwhelmed - and we'll continue to have our assumptions of what is 'safe' from flooding challenged.""

Unlike some disasters, flooding - especially on this scale - is a long haul, says Lori Arnold, director of the Greater Arkansas American Red Cross.

The Red Cross has been operating 10 shelters in Arkansas and around as many in neighbouring states. In addition to providing food and a safe place to stay to hundreds, Ms Arnold notes the volunteers have been providing mental health services, too.

Midwesterners are proud of being self-sufficient, she says. Many try to last out the floods in their own homes as long as possible. But this year things have been different.

""People living on the riverbanks, they're used to flooding and they hear about this all the time,"" Ms Arnold says. ""The hardest thing for them is flooding fatigue.""

She says many shelter residents have told her that they were reticent to leave their homes because of how many times official warnings had exaggerated the situation.

""So for those who actually had to leave, they're a bit in shock because they'd gotten immune to it.""

The Mississippi and its tributary, the Missouri, make-up the longest river system in North America. Floods are expected - but 2019 harkens back to the worst of them. The swollen rivers this spring have broken a dam in one instance and dramatically breached levees across the region.

""In our part of the world, you think of 1952, 1993, and now we're going to think about 2019,"" Missouri farmer Blake Hurst says.

In 1993, following persistent spring and summer storms, the waters of the Mississippi lurched over their banks and flooded 400,000 sq miles across nine states. Fifty people died. Damages were close to $15bn (£11bn).

It rained nearly every day in June and July of 1993. Forecasts for 2019 predict between 33-50% chances of above-average rainfall on the Midwest's already water-logged soil.

This week, the National Weather Service had flood alerts along the Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas and Mississippi rivers. Waters are receding in parts, but the NWS reports 125 river gauges from Minnesota to Missouri predict a 50% or greater chance of flooding from June to August.

On Sunday, the Mississippi crested in St Louis at just over 46ft - its second-highest in history, and only 3.5ft short of its 1993 record, according to the NWS.

And all along the Midwest, the river stands to break records from 1927 if it remains at flood levels through the summer. AccuWeather estimates the flooding damage along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers is already over $12bn.

But, barring another system of severe storms, ""we're sort of on the downhill side, I hope"", Mr Hurst says. He adds: ""Just because we haven't had rain in a few days doesn't mean that people's homes are dry or that their farms aren't covered with water.""

And some of the farms that have flooded, he says, were still dealing with damage from local flooding in 2011.

As the floodwaters ebb and the acres of drowned land emerge again, a long clean-up process begins. The receding water leaves feet of sand and mud, rubbish and sewage in its wake, but it will be months yet before proper clean-up efforts can start - let alone farming.

Mr Hurst says some farmers believe climate change has caused the severe weather this year, while others blame improper management of river operations.

""It doesn't matter whether our problem is caused by poor management or climate change, we need to figure out how to do better,"" he tells me.

""Having said all that: Would any kind of management of the river prevented flooding in 2019? No. There's nothing that could have prevented this.""

It's day two of the official campaign to be the next prime minister.

Andrea Leadsom cheerily launched her campaign, promising she would never utter the phrase ""as a mother"" that did for her chances last time.

She did though, unusually, say ""never say never"" to the idea of another Scottish independence referendum, normally an anathema to Tory candidates.

Expect the SNP to have fun with the idea of another vote - which remember would require the nod from Westminster - and Scottish Conservatives to be nervous.

As promised, the former chief whip Mark Harper was jacket off, sleeves rolled up, answering any question that journalists were willing to put.

That included - because the early stages of this campaign are this surreal - predicting in a fight between a lion and a bear that the lion, patriotically, would win. (yes, you read that right).

He did, though, repeat his assertion that none of the candidates aside from him were being straight about the possibilities for Brexit.

He'll say, as many times as he can and with a fair amount of evidence to back him up, that the odds of the UK leaving on Halloween aren't that high. (Nothing of course is impossible, and plenty of the candidates say they will do everything to make that happen.)

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Andrea Leadsom reflected on mistakes in her campaign three years ago

And as I write, early on Tuesday evening, Rory Stewart - Boris Johnson's fellow Old Etonian who predicts that they will be the final two - is on stage at a comedy venue launching his campaign proper.

And TV presenter Lorraine Kelly was back - this time with a slapdown of the whole lot of the political class, prompting suggestions in the Westminster bubble that maybe she should be allowed to pick the winner, so the country could just get on with its important business.

Outside of SW1, plenty of you might well agree.

But the hard reality bites today too. Labour has just announced that they are leading another cross-party attempt to grab control of the Commons.

If they're successful, they would try to introduce a law to block the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place, and to stop any future prime minister suspending Parliament so that we leave whatever happens - as has been suggested by some of the wannabe leaders.

Right now, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey and, of course, the front runner Boris Johnson, are all suggesting the UK ought to leave at the end of October - Brexit or bust. You can read more about the candidates' different plans here.

Just in case the candidates needed a reminder of what they'll inherit, the politician who wins this race might find that MPs have changed the law to kill off their solution to Brexit before they even call the removal vans to move their stuff to Number 10.

Two-thirds of students support universities being able to warn parents if students have a mental health crisis, an annual survey suggests.

There have been concerns about student suicides and the survey indicated worsening levels of anxiety on campus.

Only 14% reported ""life satisfaction"", in this study of 14,000 UK students.

And most thought even though students were independent adults, universities should in an emergency be allowed to disclose information to parents.

Published by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and Advance HE, this is one of the biggest annual reports into the views of those currently studying in the UK's universities.

'Under pressure'

The 2019 survey showed continuing concerns about students' well-being - with just 18% saying they were happy, 17% saying their life was ""worthwhile"" and only 16% having low levels of anxiety, with all these student figures being considerably worse than for the rest of their age group.

It showed 66% supported universities being able to share concerns with parents or a trusted adult if there were ""extreme"" problems - and a further 15% thought universities should be able to contact parents in ""any circumstances"" where there were mental health worries.

There were 18% who thought universities should never be allowed to get in touch with parents.

The University of Bristol, which has faced a number of student suicides, has a scheme in which students can opt-in to allowing parents or trusted adults to be contacted - with a take-up of 95%.

Ben Murray, after the death of his son James who was a student at Bristol, has worked with the university on improving support.

""Mental health has been ignored for too long and we need to encourage disclosure at exactly the time when young adults need it most - transitioning from school to university,"" said Mr Murray.

Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, said the survey showed the pressure that some students could feel from being ""away from friends and family"" and how some struggled with the ""big break"" from home.

Report author Jonathan Neves said it showed how students felt ""under a lot of pressure"".

Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""The survey dispels the fiction that students don't want their parents and guardians involved.

""It's incredibly difficult for many students to transition to university. And having parents and guardians more involved when appropriate is good sense, and can only help, including helping save lives,"" said Sir Anthony.

Value for money

Last month, Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed a report from Philip Augar calling for a cut in tuition fees in England - saying the maximum should be reduced from £9,250 to £7,500 per year.

The survey showed that for the 29% of students who thought they were getting ""poor"" or ""very poor"" value for money, the biggest factor was the level of fees.

Image copyright Getty Images

The proportion saying they were getting ""good"" or ""very good"" value had risen - but only to 41%.

Chris Skidmore, the universities minister, said that if fees were reduced as the Augar review recommended, then there would need to be ""top-up"" funding for universities to replace the lost income.

Speaking at the Hepi conference, he said that improving funding for further education should not be at the expense of higher education, saying ""you can't rob Peter to pay Paul"".

He argued that there should be more students going to university rather than less - and he reiterated his opposition to setting a minimum grade threshold, such as requiring students to get a least three D grades at A-level.

Mr Skidmore said this would be an unfair block on those who did not have the opportunity to get good A-levels at school, but who ""flourished later on in life"".

Better teaching

The student satisfaction survey showed that within the UK, students in Scotland, where there are no fees for Scottish students, were much more likely to think they had good value, compared with those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The most common driving factor for those with positive views was the quality of teaching - and the report suggested improving teaching was the way to increase perceptions of good value.

But the survey showed the average number of ""contact hours"", where students are directly taught in class, had not increased significantly - from 13.4 hours per week in 2015 to 13.9 hours this year.

Mr Hillman said the survey showed ""students want to be stretched, they want clearer feedback and they want more support for mental health challenges"".",Sean Coughlan,13 June 2019,Students want parents to be told in mental health crisis,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48611593

The crisis in the Gulf has moved up a gear, with the US providing the first element of the intelligence it insists demonstrates that Iran was responsible for Thursday's attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.

Although much remains to be revealed about the incidents, as far as the Trump administration is concerned, the evidence is clear.

This inevitably raises questions about what happens next: how might the US respond? The stakes are high.

What is the danger of a full-scale air and maritime conflict between Washington and Tehran?

The grainy video released by the Pentagon showing what is claimed to be a small Iranian vessel - its crew detaching an unexploded limpet mine from the hull of one of the two tankers attacked on Thursday - is a powerful first salvo in the battle to establish what actually happened.

However, in the highly charged environment of the social media age, this is inevitably a struggle as much about perceptions as reality.

To their respective camps of critics, both the Iranian and Trump administrations are toxic.

Iran has denied from the outset any involvement, as it did with the four limpet-mine attacks on ships off the United Arab Emirates in May. The US has now blamed both episodes on Tehran. And there is a clear danger that this war of words could spill over into outright conflict.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mike Pompeo: ""Unprovoked attacks a clear threat to peace and security""

Last night, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo swiftly and categorically pointed the finger of blame at Iran.

""This assessment,"" he said, was ""based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.""

Iran for its part was quick to deny any involvement in the incidents. Indeed it sought to deflect blame by arguing in effect that it was being framed.

""Somebody,"" an Iranian official asserted, ""is trying to destabilise relations between Iran and the international community.""

Odd chronology?

On the face of things, the US Navy's video is persuasive. But it still leaves many questions unanswered. It was after all recorded some time after the initial explosions - when the Iranians, it seems, according to the implication of the US narrative - were seeking to remove some of the incriminating evidence.

But more needs to be revealed about the chronology of these attacks. When, for example, were the mines actually attached to the vessels?

The US has remarkable intelligence gathering capabilities in the region, where there is already a powerful US naval presence. More information will undoubtedly be available and a forensic examination of the damage to the two vessels should also yield further evidence.

However, the burden of the US case goes way beyond this most recent attacks. Iran, the Trump administration insists, has form.

Mr Pompeo made an expansive case, insisting that ""taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation, and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension"".

These are hefty charges and the question inevitably follows: what is the US prepared to do about it?

Concerted diplomatic action might be one approach; an effort to marshal international condemnation together with an effort to further isolate Iran through additional economic sanctions.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards is estimated to have more than 150,000 active personnel

But there is little doubt that stepped up sanctions, rightly or wrongly, have contributed to the current situation, increasing the pressure on Tehran, perhaps to the extent that some elements in the country - maybe the Revolutionary Guard Corps which maintains autonomous naval forces of its own - has decided to strike back.

So now what happens? Could the US seek to take some kind of punitive military response?

What will be the view of its allies among the Gulf States and farther afield? And what could be the consequences of military action ?

Dangerous times

There is a very real danger that Iran, if attacked, could launch a kind of hybrid war - both directly and through its proxies - carrying out sporadic and widely dispersed attacks on shipping and other targets, sending oil prices and insurance premiums up and perhaps encouraging further punitive responses.

It is an unpalatable prospect for all concerned, risking dangerous escalation. Nobody really thinks that either Iran or the US wants a full-scale conflict.

For the Americans, despite their considerable military power, an air and maritime war against Iran would raise all sorts of dangers.

And President Trump, for all his sometimes bellicose rhetoric, has so far proved reluctant to take significant military action abroad. US strikes in Syria during his watch were largely symbolic.

The fear now is that Iran, through its own misreading of the situation, may have given the hawkish voices in the US administration the grounds they need to launch some kind of punitive response.

The danger, as ever, is for war by accident rather than by design.

Tehran and Washington are signalling their resolve to each other, but they may not be receiving quite the messages that each intends.

Iran, for example, may see the US build-up in the region partly as bluster and partly as an effort at intimidation in what it sees as its own backyard - intimidation that it is not disposed to accept.

Just suppose elements in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, for example, misunderstand the signals.

Suppose they believe that they have much more freedom to assert themselves in Gulf waters than the Americans are prepared to accept.

In other words, rather than as they may see it, ""pushing at the envelope"", they are straying into actions that Washington and its allies will simply not allow to go unpunished, This is a recipe for conflict, intentional or otherwise. These are dangerous times.

Many of Washington's allies, like France and Germany, are already urging caution.

The British foreign minister said that while the UK trusted the US, it would draw its own conclusion.

""We are going to make our own independent assessment, we have our processes to do that,"" Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Today programme. ""We have no reason not to believe the American assessment and our instinct is to believe it, because they are our closest ally.""

Mr Trump must weigh up any response carefully.

When he first came to office, there were many - even Republican foreign policy experts - who refused to have anything to do with his administration, insisting that his mercurial and erratic approach to foreign affairs would provoke a crisis.

For a time, that looked as though it might involve North Korea or maybe even Syria. But each time, the moment of drama passed.

Now a fully fledged crisis is facing the White House. How it responds will have crucial implications, not just for the Middle East, but also for the wider pattern of relationships between the US and its traditional partners in the Gulf and elsewhere, many of whom are unsure of how to deal with this president and his unique diplomatic style.",Jonathan Marcus,14 June 2019,"Iran, the US and the Gulf: What now?",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48631320

The margin of success took his fellow candidates by surprise - but not the core of Boris Johnson's team.

After many, many weeks of private campaigning, introducing Boris Johnson to the world of the spreadsheet, this morning one of his organisers wrote the number 114 and sealed it in an envelope.

At lunchtime, the announcement revealed the controversial former foreign secretary had indeed received exactly that number.

That is not just a marker of the level of Mr Johnson's support, but for the sometimes clownish politician, whose reputation has risen and fallen and then risen again, it's a sign that it is different this time.

His campaign has extended way beyond his old friends. The discipline his lieutenants are trying to instil is holding at this stage.

But his success today leaves him vulnerable.

Frontrunner status is a precious commodity. It makes him the target for all of the others left in the race, for all of them to pitch themselves to those many MPs who feel strongly that he is wrong for the job.

So members of his campaign team tell me their motto is simple - do not die. His place in the final two of the race to become our prime minister is secure, unless he errs explosively. With Boris Johnson, that is not a secure bet. And once in that final duet, weeks of scrutiny and challenge await.

There is a choice for those who want to stop him now. Discussions are live tonight between the other camps in the race over what to do next.

Should there be an effort to come together behind one candidate who could beat Mr Johnson?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said tonight - arriving back at the Pall Mall mansion that used to be Mr Johnson's formal residence, of course - that he is the person to take him on. Although he had fewer votes than expected today, he's clearly not going to pull out.

Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock though, the home and health secretaries, met this afternoon after the results.

Sources close to Mr Hancock say he's ""mulling over"" what to do next. There's no final decision, but don't be hugely surprised if by Friday lunchtime he has withdrawn from the contest.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption One of the only things we can be sure of: The next prime minister will be a man

Rory Stewart though is not going anywhere. He is instead ramping up his rhetoric against his fellow Old Etonian (yes, he and Boris Johnson did not just go to the same school, but also to the same Oxford college), and talking boldly about how only he can be the person to take him on.

Given his place on the political spectrum frankly that seems extremely unlikely, however many views his videos get on Twitter.

And while his team are extremely gung-ho, and he has built up some impressive momentum, some MPs from the so-called One Nation, (centre-ish) part of the Tory party are pretty cross, telling me that either Javid or Hancock had a decent crack if he would get out of the way.

There is plenty more of this political intrigue to come in the next week or so, whether it bores you to tears or is the insider manoeuvring that excites you. It's fluid, and there is, as I tediously probably always say, a long way to go.

Researchers have uncovered the earliest known evidence of cannabis use, from tombs in western China.

The study suggests cannabis was being smoked at least 2,500 years ago, and that it may have been associated with ritual or religious activities.

Traces of the drug were identified in wooden burners from the burials.

The cannabis had high levels of the psychoactive compound THC, suggesting people at the time were well aware of its effects.

Cannabis plants have been cultivated in East Asia for their oily seeds and fibre from at least 4,000 BC.

But the early cultivated varieties of cannabis, as well as most wild populations, had low levels of THC and other psychoactive compounds.

The burners, or braziers, were found at Jirzankal Cemetery, high up in the Pamir Mountains.

The scientists think ancient people put cannabis leaves and hot stones in the braziers and inhaled the resulting smoke.

Image copyright Xinhua Wu Image caption Tomb M12, where the wooden burner was found

It's possible the high altitude environment caused the cannabis plants in this region to naturally produce higher levels of THC. There's evidence this can happen in response to low temperatures, low nutrient levels and other conditions associated with high elevations.

But people could have deliberately bred plants with higher levels of THC than wild varieties.

It's the earliest clear evidence of cannabis being used for its psychoactive properties. The plants appear to have been burnt as part of funerary rituals.

The scientists used a method called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to isolate and identify compounds preserved in the burners.

To their surprise, the chemical signature of the isolated compounds was an exact match to the chemical signature of cannabis.

The findings tally with other early evidence for the presence of cannabis from burials further north, in the Xinjiang region of China and in the Altai Mountains of Russia.

In addition, tests on human bones from the cemetery show that some of the people here did not grow up locally.

Nicole Boivin, director at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, said: ""The findings support the idea that cannabis plants were first used for their psychoactive compounds in the mountainous regions of eastern Central Asia, thereafter spreading to other regions of the world.""

In a video on Instagram this week, Mark Zuckerberg confessed to controlling the stolen data of billions of people and said he owed it all to an organisation called Spectre.

The video was of course faked, and on this week's Tech Tent we examine the dilemma it posed for Instagram's owner Facebook.

Stream the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC Sounds

A few weeks ago, the social media giant came under fire for allowing a doctored video of the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to remain up.

So how would it react when the faked video of its founder emerged?

The video featured the real Mark Zuckerberg, but the voice and the words emerging from his mouth were not his.

It was the work of two artists, Daniel Howe and a man going by the name of Bill Posters, and was part of an installation on show in Sheffield this week.

When we spoke to Bill Posters he told us that the video had been planned long before the row over Facebook's treatment of Nancy Pelosi.

The aim was to throw a light on Facebook's business model, which involved using behavioural psychology to persuade people to share intimate details of their lives so that they could be targeted with advertising.

""We're shining the light on Facebook and Zuckerberg himself to ask what happens now when it's your privacy and your data that's been used in obscure or unintended ways"" he said.

Unsurprisingly, Facebook did not remove the video, It said it followed the same policy as with the Nancy Pelosi video and other misinformation on its services - let third party fact-checkers determine whether it was fake, and then make it less visible in users' feeds rather than taking it down.

#deepfake

Bill Posters points out that the video featured the hashtag #deepfake and was never meant to deceive anybody.

It is hard to believe that anybody happening across this artwork with a voice which sounds nothing like Mark Zuckerberg would be fooled.

But month by month, deepfake technology is getting ever more sophisticated.

Soon, it will become extremely difficult to spot whether words have been put into the mouths of politicians, or whether celebrities' faces have been placed in scenes where they were not present.

Both identifying such videos and deciding what to do about them will become an even greater challenge for Facebook's moderators, while giving the company a powerful role in determining the limits of free expression.

Bill Posters says that means things need to change.

""To do that it needs collective understanding of very hard, obscure, hidden technologies and methods. But it also needs regulatory oversight as well,"" he said.

Regulation time?

The call for regulation of Facebook and the other US tech giants is getting louder - from Europe in particular.

Tech Tent also hears from European Commissioner Carlos Moedas and leading UK tech figure Hermann Hauser, who both insist that Europe is setting the pace - with the GDPR data privacy directive just one example.

Scientists have destroyed the UK's laboratory stocks of a virus that once caused devastating cattle losses.

These stocks accounted for most of the world's lab samples of rinderpest, which were held at The Pirbright Institute in Surrey.

Rinderpest and the deadly smallpox virus are the only diseases to have been eradicated from the face of the Earth.

BBC News had exclusive access to the destruction of the final samples.

Dr Carrie Batten, from The Pirbright Institute, described the moment as ""the end of an era"".

""Rinderpest was devastating and by removing the stocks that are held globally you are essentially reducing the risk dramatically,"" she said.

Image copyright FAO Image caption Rinderpest devastated cattle in Africa during the 1890s. Millions of people died from starvation.

Dr Michael Baron, honorary fellow at the institute, said the end of rinderpest would mark the beginning of a new war on other diseases.

""The success we have achieved with rinderpest has been one of the main drivers for people saying we can do this with other animal diseases and other human diseases such as polio, mumps and measles. These diseases are eradicable and this should be done,"" he explained.

Human catastrophe

The rinderpest virus is responsible for one of the worst catastrophes in history. During an outbreak in the 1890s, it killed between 80% and 90% of cattle in eastern and southern Africa. This caused mass starvation in the region.

Millions of people died as a result. In Ethiopia alone, one-third of the human population was wiped out. The toll in lives was on a scale matched only by the Black Death in Europe.

A vaccination campaign eventually brought the disease under control until it was declared to have been eradicated in the wild in 2011.

But thousands of samples of the virus remained in 40 laboratories across 36 countries. If there happened to be an accident, the disease could potentially leak out and cause devastation once again.

To prevent this, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) approved a few highly secure labs and encouraged other institutes to send their rinderpest samples to these facilities.

Among them is the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, which has led efforts to record the genetic information contained in each sample and then destroy it.

Researchers have been reluctant to destroy lab samples of deadly viruses in case they are needed to create a vaccine should the disease ever re-emerge. But a digital record of the virus's genetic code means that this is no longer an issue.

And so Pirbright has been able to destroy all its samples which account for most of the laboratory rinderpest virus in the world.

Dr Samia Metwally, of the FAO, hopes that Pirbright's success will encourage other holding facilities to follow suit so that it is completely eliminated from the face of the Earth.

""This is a huge step by Pirbright. It sets a precedent for other countries to do the same.""

Dr Monique Eloit, the OIE's director-general, told BBC News that she was ""very happy"" about the development.

""All the work done by farmers, veterinarians and scientists for such a long time is on track to minimise the risk of the re-emergence of rinderpest,"" she said.

The government's chief vet, Dr Christine Middlemiss, welcomed the news. ""It is such a devastating disease. 100% of susceptible animals become infected and die from the virus. So to have that removed as a threat is fantastic,"" she said.

The World Health Organization has decided not to declare a global emergency over the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The WHO said Ebola was ""very much an emergency"" in the region, but it did not pose a global threat.

However, it was damning of countries for giving less than half the money needed to deal with the disease.

The deadly outbreak - the second largest in history - has killed more than 1,400 people.

This week cases were detected across the border in Uganda, though the virus is not yet spreading there.

Declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern is one of the most important acts the WHO can take.

It has done so only four times before - including for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa which killed more than 11,000 people.

Such a decision usually means getting more money and healthcare workers to tackle an outbreak - or political support to stop the fighting to let medics get the job done.

So why is Ebola not a global emergency?

This was not a straightforward decision.

Dr Preben Aavitsland, the acting chair of the WHO's emergency committee, said there was extensive debate and differing views at the emergency meeting.

The outbreak met some of the criteria for a global emergency as it was both an extraordinary event and risked international spread.

However, he said efforts on the ground ""would not be enhanced"" by declaring an emergency.

Dr Aavitsland said: ""This is not a global emergency, it is an emergency in DRC, it is a severe emergency.""

But he warned declaring an emergency could lead to border closures or airlines refusing to fly to DRC, which could do more harm than good.

""There is nothing to gain, but there is a lot to lose,"" he said.

The WHO has previously discussed whether the Ebola outbreak in DRC should be declared an emergency on two occasions.

Both times it decided not to, in part because Ebola was deemed a threat in only in the region rather than internationally.

How bad is the situation in DRC?

The outbreak started in August 2018 and is affecting two provinces in DRC - North Kivu and Ituri.

More than 2,100 people have been infected and over 1,400 have died.

It took 224 days for the number of cases to reach 1,000, but just a further 71 days to reach 2,000.

There are some positive signs with the number of new cases slowing - there were 54 cases in the past week compared with 88 in each of the two previous weeks.

However, 54 cases is still more than the totality of many Ebola outbreaks.

Tackling the disease has been complicated by conflict in the region - between January and May there were more than 40 attacks on health facilities.

Another problem is distrust of healthcare workers with about a third of deaths being in the community rather than at a specialist Ebola treatment centre.

It means those people are not seeking treatment and risk spreading the disease to neighbours and relatives.

Has the virus spread to other countries?

Two people have died from Ebola in neighbouring Uganda - a five-year-old boy and his 50-year-old grandmother.

They were members of a family that crossed the border from DRC.

While the WHO says such cases are of ""grave concern"" is says there is no evidence of the virus spreading in Uganda.

Twenty-seven people are said to have been in contact with the infected family. They have all been restricted to their homes and will be offered the Ebola vaccine.

Is the world doing enough to help?

The WHO is clear that more needs to be done.

It said that between February and July it needed $98m to tackle the outbreak, but it was facing a shortfall of $54m.

Sir Jeremy Farrar, from the Wellcome medical research charity, said: ""A step up in the response with full international support is critical if we're to bring the epidemic to an end and ensure protection for the communities at risk.

""The response in DRC remains overstretched and underfunded.""

5d04dd05ad0d019b7c5b4725,"It is June 1998 and Paula Rego is furious. Her people, the Portuguese people, had not turned up in sufficient numbers to vote in the recently held national referendum to change the country's conservative abortion law.

The London-based artist was appalled.

As someone who had endured the life-threatening brutality of back-street abortions she was dismayed the Portuguese - particularly the women - had passed up the chance to legalise the termination of pregnancies on request up to 10 weeks from conception.

The wholly avoidable deaths and distress suffered by thousands of women resorting to illegal abortions every year would continue. No wonder her father had said Portugal was no place for a woman, before packing off his talented teenage daughter to England to hone her painterly skills at The Slade School of Fine Art in London.

She sat in her Camden Town studio and fumed, determined to do something about the situation; to change public opinion back home; to make a difference. Which she did (the law was changed in 2007). By doing what she always did when overwhelmed with anger. She created a group of troubling, ominous images.

Image copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Paula Rego's abortion series began with this dark and searingly honest Triptych, 1998

Rego's abortion pictures are as confrontational and direct as a John Humphrys interview.

There's no flim-flam, no tip-toeing around the topic: she gets straight to the point… which is darkly ambiguous.

She is both explicit and vague.

There is an equivocation that makes for uncomfortable viewing. Her truth resides in psychological complexity however awkward it may be. To Rego, the grim reality of a back-street abortion is not intellectually straightforward. It is not simply a case of a bad thing happening.

Look at any of the imposingly large pictures she made in this series and you will be disturbed.

There is an uneasy eroticism bound up in the pain and the squalor. The schoolgirls and young women depicted challenge the unseen figure with a physicality and preparedness. Have they girded up their loins in anticipation of an impending termination or something else?

Welcome to Paula Rego World, where there is always something nasty in the woodshed.

Image copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption With Untitled No. 5, 1998 and others in her abortion series, Paula Rego says ""they are not pictures of victims""

To see a Rego picture is to be thrust into the midst of a sinister gothic drama. A fat-ankled lady wearing a walnut-like skirt bends down to lift a prone dog by its front legs in Snare (1987). She leans forward as if to give the animal a sensual kiss, a red rose in the foreground suggests love. Near it, a crab lies powerless on its back mirroring the dog's vulnerability. It is rich with symbolism and menace.

It is also technically very good.

The red-to-brown palette has the tonal harmony of Picasso's impeccable portrait of Gertrude Stein (1905-6). The suggested volume of the figures is as convincing as a mirage in the desert. And the weight the lady's legs bear, and pressure of the grip with which she holds the dog, are palpable.

It is a very good figurative painting.

Image copyright Paula Rego Image caption Snare, 1987 is a key work full of symbolism - with the skirt concealing ""secrets""

It marks the moment Rego found her signature style.

There had always been a strong narrative element to her work, whether back in the 1960s when she was making cut-up collages like The Imposter (1964) critiquing the Estado novo authoritarian regime in Portugal. Or, in the early '80s with abstracted, cartoon-like paintings such as Red Monkey Offers Bear A Poisoned Dove (1981), lampooning the love triangle she constructed between her husband and her paramour.

Image copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Paula Rego criticised the Portuguese dictatorship in works like The Imposter, 1964

But these were works in progress towards the stylised tableaus and heavy-featured figures that are now instantly recognisable as a Paula Rego. Hers is an idiosyncratic aesthetic heightened later by the use of oil pastel crayons instead of acrylic paint, a mid-career decision made - I am told - in part to help her stop smoking.

The results are impressive.

Turn 180 degrees from the Abortion Series hanging in the central space of the MK Gallery, and there, on the opposite wall, are her Dog Women pictures from the early 1990s.

They were inspired by the French Impressionist painter, Edgar Degas. He was an artist famous for his use of pastels and elevated perspective, from which he portrayed dainty dancers in ballet rehearsals. His representations of a woman's physique and inner life were voyeuristic, with a hint of the dirty-old-man about them. Rego's couldn't be more different.

Image copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Degas' viewpoint of looking down on the model can be seen in Rego's Sleeper, 1994

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dancers, 1884-1885 by Degas, who influenced Rego with what she says were ""his marvellous use of pastels""

Her Dog Women are more like werewolves; snarling creatures that are both loyal and fiercely independent. The pictures are a response to the death of her husband, the artist Victor (Vic) Willing whom she met while a student at The Slade.

She considered Vic her intellectual and artistic superior, a point of view he was in no rush to counter. His critical eye helped her work develop but petrified his own. Life got complicated. He was already married. She went back to Portugal.

Vic left his wife and went to live with Paula. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. They both had affairs. Her father died. Vic took over the family business and ran it into the ground. They returned to London, penniless. Paula found a lover to help pay the way. Vic began to paint again shortly before he died.

Theirs was a passionate, painful, profound relationship, which Rego renders in pastel with disarming sincerity. Woman becomes dog-like, part domesticated and part wild animal. She lies on her owner's jacket in Sleeper (1994), is kicked out of bed in Bad Dog (1994), and roars in rage in Dog Woman (1994).

Image copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Paula Rego's belief that ""every woman's a dog woman, not downtrodden, but powerful"" is reflected in Dog Woman, 1994

But it is in Sit (1994) that Rego captures the specific and the universal of her marriage to Vic with an emotional intensity you won't quickly forget.

The female figure is doing as she has been told, sitting obediently in her chair. Her hands are behind her back, possibly bound. Her feet are crossed in the manner of the crucified Christ. She is pregnant.

She looks up and away at her tormentor, her owner, her lover. She is trapped, subjugated, but in no way tamed. Her eyes blaze with defiance, her body emits power. There is an air of sexuality and violence, love and hate; beauty and the grotesque.

It is a uniquely good picture.

Image copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption Obedience and defiance are apparent in Sit, 1994, which seems to be a stark metaphor about Rego's marriage

It's not the best image ever created. It is not even the best image Paula Rego has ever created - The Dance (not in this exhibition) - is better.

But it is exceptional.

We've seen plenty of male artists picturing woman in myriad different ways, but who else has painted the world from a female point of view in the manner described by Paula Rego?

Louise Bourgeois and Frida Kahlo had similar concerns, and expressed them just as unflinchingly, But Rego's voice is more literary, painterly and poetic in the way of Edgar Allan Poe. She references the Brontë sisters, Edvard Munch, William Hogarth and Francisco Goya.

She is a romantic surrealist with a satirist's cutting edge.

Image copyright Paula Rego/Marlborough Fine Art Image caption The figure in Angel, 1998 is a symbol of female power and strength

Quite why she is not more famous is difficult to fathom. Maybe her gender and style went against her? A bit too much for all those buttoned-up male museum directors whose stripped back modernist tastes ruled the roost for far too long.

Their time has come and gone.

The game is changing.

I can't recall another exhibition season quite like this summer's, when there are so many monographic shows dedicated to female artists being staged across the country.

It brings to mind the female figure in Sit. She knew her time would come. And so it has. It is now.

5d04dd07ad0d019b7c5b4727,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amazon executive Werner Vogels on the ethics of facial recognition

""I see Amazon as a technology company that just happened to do retail,"" begins Werner Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer.

""When Jeff [Bezos] started Amazon, he wasn't thinking about starting a bookshop. He was really fascinated by the internet.”

Only ""mortal humans"", he tells me in an interview, ever saw Amazon as merely a retailer. So the question now is: what will Amazon become next? And are mere mortals ready for it?

Its recent Re:Mars event in Las Vegas demonstrated clearly - through presentations about machine-learning, robotics and space - that the firm is going through a transition phase that, if successful, will redefine its relationship with the public.

Amazon's incredible, sophisticated systems are no longer being used just to serve up good deals, fast delivery times, or cheap web storage. Its big data capabilities are now the tool of police forces, and maybe soon the military. In the corporate world, Amazon is positioning itself to be the “brains” behind just about everything.

In short, New Amazon could make today's Amazon look quaint in both scale and power.

Next major phase

Amazon, of course, knows this. Which is why, for an entire week earlier this month, the firm, typically reluctant to engage too deeply with the press, did so with enthusiasm: dinners, interviews, and remarkably frank discussions about its ambitions.

Among the Re:Mars speakers was Mr Vogels. He’s considered - alongside Mr Bezos - one of the company's true visionaries, in part thanks to his creation of Amazon Web Services, which, as of now, accounts for most of Amazon's profits.

AWS essentially meant small companies which would not be able to afford big severs of their own now could - and that server space would grow (or shrink) in accordance with their needs.

As a result, Amazon provides the infrastructure backbone for major firms such as AirBnB and Netflix, as well as more than one million other clients who collectively give Amazon ""control"" of large swathes of the web. When AWS suffered a technical glitch in 2017, tech site Gizmodo said it simply ""destroyed the internet"". There are competing major cloud platforms - from Microsoft and Google - but AWS is on top.

The firm is now looking to have a similar impact with the next major phase in computing: machine-learning and artificial intelligence. ML and AI, for short.

“There's only a certain set of problems for which you need to build new algorithms,” Mr Vogels tells me, suggesting for everything else, companies should just use Amazon.

“The use of machine-learning will greatly explode if everyone can do it.”

He wants to offer companies access to technologies they could not create themselves, such as Textract (“automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents”) or Lex, which uses the same technology as the Alexa voice assistant to turn voice recordings into text.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Amazon is best known by consumers for its retail website

‘Not my decision’

Among the tools it is offering, Amazon’s image recognition product is the most controversial. For a per-minute fee of a few pence, Amazon Rekognition can scan video footage and, for example, pick up people’s faces that can then be checked against a client’s database.

Civil rights groups have called it “perhaps the most dangerous surveillance technology ever developed”, and called for Amazon to stop selling it to government agencies, particularly police forces. City supervisors in San Francisco banned its use, saying the software is not only intrusive, but biased - it’s better at recognising white people than black and Asian people.

Mr Vogels doesn’t feel it's Amazon’s responsibility to make sure Rekognition is used accurately or ethically.

“That’s not my decision to make,” he tells me.

“This technology is being used for good in many places. It’s in society’s direction to actually decide which technology is applicable under which conditions.

“It’s a societal discourse and decision - and policy-making - that needs to happen to decide where you can apply technologies.”

He likens ML and AI to steel mills. Sometimes steel is used to make incubators for babies, he says, but sometimes steel is used to make guns.

‘Add a comma’

Amazon’s new forays will attract scrutiny. In its immediate future, it - along with other tech giants - has to answer claims of being anti-competitive, and calls from some presidential candidates for it to be broken up. If it succeeds in its vision to use data to provide ML and AI to the masses, defending itself might become more difficult.

Amazon will need to answer continued questioning about how it handles user privacy, and whether it is being entirely up-front with users when it comes to how data is stored and analysed.

A small taste of this has come from the recent furore over its Alexa smart voice assistant, more than 100 million of which have been sold worldwide.

Reports earlier this year revealed how in some instances, isolated, anonymised recordings were being listened to by human staff - a possibility you could argue isn’t explicitly stated in the firm’s privacy policy.

“It’s a tiny fraction of 1% of the voice recordings,” explained Dave Limp, Amazon’s head of Alexa, to the BBC.

“And obviously customers have complete control of those voice recordings. So if anybody's concerned, they can delete those recordings.”

He conceded, however, that the company could perhaps make it clearer to its customers in future.

“I think we could add a comma and be more specific,” he said of the firm’s privacy policy.

We’ll have to wait and see if it actually does.

Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon was criticised for not giving enough information about what is done with data gathered by its smart speakers

Work to do

Amazon points to the many benefits this kind of technology can bring at scale - particularly machine-learning efforts that are able to sift through information at a rate no human team, however large, ever could.

For instance, Rekognition is being used by an anti-sex-trafficking non-profit organisation, Thorn, to scrape classified ad sites and search for matches against a database of missing teenagers.

But events like Re:Mars demonstrate that Amazon knows it has work to do in gaining the public’s trust in order to go ahead with its ambitions.

One non-Amazon guest on stage, the AI pioneer Andrew Ng, gave a pretty scathing review of the technology industry’s reputation - and food for thought for his hosts.

“Even as we lead the world through multiple waves of technological disruption, we’ve not always provided the best leadership.

“With the rise of the internet, we’ve created tremendous wealth, but we also contributed to wealth inequality.

“Let’s make sure that this time, with the rise of AI, we take everyone along with us.”

Both firms had unveiled the devices in February but Huawei said it now wanted to be ""cautious"".

Samsung currently has no release date for the Fold.

Huawei confirmed to the BBC that the Mate X is expected to launch in September 2019.

The days of long, booze-fuelled City lunches appear to be nearing an end as the London Metal Exchange becomes the latest firm to introduce a booze ban.

The exchange has said that all staff who work on its trading floor can no longer drink during working hours.

The ban affects about 120 personnel - from traders to clerks - of nine different firms who work in the Ring.

The move follows similar rules on alcohol and drugs from Lloyd's of London, introduced earlier this year.

""The LME appreciates the high standards upheld by its members, and has formalised the general position that Ring-based personnel should not consume any alcohol prior to conducting business,"" said a spokesperson.

The BBC understands that the decision is not related to any particular incident, but the exchange faced criticism earlier this year after one of its clients hosted a cocktail party at the Playboy club in Mayfair using LME branding.

In May, the exchange appointed its first ever female chairman Gay Huey.

The nine firms that work on the trading floor are currently in consultation with LME to decide how best to enforce the new regulations, which are not limited to the typical 9-5 working day.

'No ambiguity'

Ben Willmott, head of public policy at human resources trade body the CIPD, said it was common for firms to have a policy around how much alcohol was reasonable in working hours, even in industries which were not safety-critical.

""It makes sense to have a policy so that there is no ambiguity. A policy may well allow appropriate lunchtime drinking. It doesn't have to be a zero-tolerance policy.""

Mr Willmott said having a policy on drinking made it easier for managers to raise the issue if there was a problem and to highlight the support available."," ",14 June 2019,Metal traders banned from workday boozing,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48635289

Two oil tankers have been significantly damaged in suspected attacks in the Gulf of Oman.

The Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous with 23 crew members aboard and Norway's Front Altair with 23 people were abandoned after the blasts. Iran and the US say they evacuated the crew.

It is unclear what caused the blasts coming amid high US-Iran tensions.

A senior Iranian official told the BBC: ""Iran has no connection with the incident.""

The suspected attack in one of the world's busiest oil routes comes a month after four oil tankers were attacked off the United Arab Emirates.

No group or country has admitted May's incident, which also caused no casualties.

The US at the time blamed Iran - but Tehran denied the accusations.

Oil prices jumped as much as 4% after Thursday's incident.

The Gulf of Oman lies at one end of the strategic Strait of Hormuz - a vital shipping lane through which hundreds of millions of dollars of oil pass.

What do we know about the explosions?

The cause has not been confirmed.

The Front Altair had been ""attacked"", the Norwegian Maritime Authority said, leading to three explosions on board.

Wu I-fang, a spokesman for Taiwan's CPC Corp oil refiner, which chartered the Front Altair, said it was carrying 75,000 tonnes of naphtha and was ""suspected of being hit by a torpedo"", although this has not been confirmed.

Other unverified reports suggested a mine attack.

The ship's owner, Frontline, said the vessel was on fire - but denied reports in Iran media it had sunk.

The operator of the Kokuka Courageous, BSM Ship Management, said its crew abandoned ship and were rescued by a passing vessel.

The tanker was carrying methanol and was not in danger of sinking, a spokesman said.

It is currently located about 130km (80 miles) from Fujairah in the UAE and 16 miles from Iran. The cargo remains intact.

The key thing now is to determine exactly what caused the damage to the two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and that will provide powerful clues as to who may have carried out the attacks.

The US has a powerful naval presence in the region and will have a range of intelligence assets to draw upon.

A US official has already noted that they believe that they will be able to recover enough debris from the attacks ""to come up with solid evidence for tracing them back to their source"".

What happens then is a question of strategic judgement.

Countries like France and Germany are already urging caution and pressing for a de-escalation.

But an attack on two merchant vessels in international waters is a hugely significant act.

And these latest attacks - unlike the sabotage with limpet mines a month ago - risked causing significant loss of life.

Who came to the rescue?

Iranian state media said Iran had rescued the crew members of both vessels and they had been taken to the port of Jask.

Image copyright Frederick A Terry/Artjom Lofitski Image caption The 21 crew on the Kokuka Courageous (L) and 23 on the Front Altair have been rescued

The US 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, said it had sent the USS Bainbridge to assist.

Spokesman Josh Frey said in a statement: ""US naval forces in the region received two separate distress calls at 06:12 local time (03:12 GMT) and a second one at 07:00.""

The US Navy later said 29 crew members from the Kokuka Courageous were taken on board the USS Bainbridge.

Why are US-Iran tensions so high?

In 2018, the US pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal reached in 2015 that was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities.

The move was strongly criticised by a number of countries, including America's closest allies.

In May, President Donald Trump tightened US sanctions on Iran - mainly targeting its oil sector.

Iran then announced it was suspending some commitments under the nuclear deal.

In recent months the US has strengthened its forces in the Gulf - saying there was a danger of Iranian attacks.

He told the Security Council that the world cannot afford ""a major confrontation in the Gulf region"".

The incident is expected to be discussed at a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council later on Thursday.

Changes to Hong Kong's extradition law could hurt the autonomy that has made it one of Asia's main financial hubs.

The government is seeking to allow extraditions to mainland China, saying it makes sure Hong Kong remains a ""safe city for residents and business"".

The proposed changes led to widespread protests in Hong Kong this week and sparked some of the worst violence seen there in decades.

Many worry that Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre is at risk.

""The passage of the proposed legislation would undermine Hong Kong's status both as a hub for multinational firm operations and as a global financial centre,"" said Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics.

So what are the proposed changes?

The changes will allow for extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoings, such as murder and rape.

Officials have said Hong Kong courts will have the final say whether to grant such extradition requests, and suspects accused of political and religious crimes will not be extradited.

Several commercial offences such as tax evasion have been removed from the list of extraditable offences.

But Hong-Kong based lawyer Antony Dapiran said this does not mean business people are ""off the hook"".

""Even though there is some reassurance in the business community that those white collar crimes have been excluded... that doesn't necessarily mean that people are therefore free of risk,"" Mr Dapiran said.

""There are many other ways that someone can be extradited under the current bill for offences other than the offence that they are actually wanted (for).""

What has the business reaction been so far?

Companies have proved reluctant to openly speak about the extradition bill for fear that their businesses in mainland China could suffer consequences.

Pushing the bill through would risk ""shooting Hong Kong in the foot,"" Tara Joseph, president of The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said in a recent newspaper interview.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hong Kong has long been a hub for global financial firms and multination corporations doing business in Asia.

Both the British Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, refused to comment when contacted by the BBC.

Andrew Coflan, analyst at New York-based political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said that the foreign business community was worried.

""Hong Kong has served as a gateway to Asia for flows of goods and capital,"" said Mr Coflan.

""But the passage of the extradition bill would turn it from a special legal entity into just another Chinese city, from a corporate risk perspective. The key risk is one of diverted or withdrawn investment.""

What happens to its special status?

The US, which is embroiled in a trade and technology dispute with China, has been vocal about its concerns surrounding the Hong Kong extradition bill.

The US expressed ""grave concern"" about the Hong Kong government's proposed amendments which ""could damage Hong Kong's business environment"" and subject American citizens there ""to China's capricious judicial system,"" Morgan Ortagus, spokesman at the US State Department said during a recent news briefing.

""The continued erosion of the 'One Country, Two Systems' framework puts at risk Hong Kong's long-established special status in international affairs,"" he said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Hong Kong government is seeking to allow extraditions to mainland China.

In 1984, Britain and China signed an agreement where Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy"" when it returned to China in 1997 under the principle of ""one country, two systems.""

As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected.

In the US, Hong Kong's special status is recognized under the US Hong Kong Policy Act but this now appears to be under scrutiny.

US lawmakers have introduced a bill to amend the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. The amendment requires the US Secretary of State to ""issue an annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy to justify special treatment"" by the US.

""The bigger issue is probably that the global perception of Hong Kong as a separate part of China is under threat. And that includes official recognition of Hong Kong as a separate customs, immigration, tax and legal jurisdiction,"" said David Webb, editor of Webb-site.com and long-time resident of Hong Kong.

""If Hong Kong loses its separate status then, for example, all of the duties that America has applied to Chinese exports would apply to Hong Kong exports. And any prohibitions on transfers of high grade technology to China would apply to Hong Kong as well.""

Any impact on Hong Kong's economy?

Hong Kong saw its worst violence in decades this week, with some government offices and banks closing due to the disruption.

Standard Chartered said on Friday the branches which were closed earlier in the week would resume operations.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protestors and police clashed this week in Hong Kong in the worst violence in the city in decades.

Some analysts expect protests to continue as long as the bill is being considered. Further protests are expected on Sunday.

But Capital Economics, pointing to the fallout of the 2014 Occupy Hong Kong protests, expects the economic impact to be limited.

""The 2014 Occupy Hong Kong protests provide a useful benchmark. They brought gridlock to large parts of Hong Kong Island for over 70 days, but there was no noticeable effect on either retail sales or tourism arrivals,"" it said in a research note.

""So even if the current protests last for several weeks, the impact on the economy is likely to be minimal. We are not changing our GDP growth forecasts for this year.""

However, analysts say other places in Asia like Singapore stand to benefit if the proposed changes go through, undermining Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.

""The main beneficiary of this development is likely to be Singapore, which has a strong legal framework and no extradition agreement with China,"" said Mr Lardy from the Peterson Institute.",Ana Nicolaci Da Costa,14 June 2019,Hong Kong extradition row: Will it damage its star status?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48618585

The main suspect in the Christchurch attacks in March, has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Brenton Tarrant is charged with the murder of 51 people, 40 counts of attempted murder and one terrorism charge in New Zealand's deadliest peace time mass shooting.

Appearing via video link from prison, the 28-year-old Australian sat silently as his lawyer read out his plea.

The 15 March attack saw a gunman open fire on Muslims during Friday prayers.

This is the first time a terrorism charge has been brought in New Zealand.

A number of the survivors of the attack and relatives of the victims were in court for the hearing, the BBC's Sydney correspondent Hywel Griffith reported.

As lawyer Shane Tait read out his client's not guilty pleas, a number of those present gasped and became tearful.

High Court Justice Cameron Mander said the trial had been set for 4 May next year, and that Mr Tarrant would be remanded in custody until a case review hearing on 16 August.

At his last court appearance in April, he was ordered to undergo mental health assessments to determine whether he was fit to stand trial.

Judge Mander said in a statement on Friday: ""No issue arises regarding the defendant's fitness to plead, to instruct counsel, and to stand his trial. A fitness hearing is not required.""

Last week, a restriction on publishing photos of the suspect's face was lifted.

'New Zealand's darkest day'

The suspect was arrested on 15 March for his alleged involvement in the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre, both located in Christchurch.

He allegedly drove first to the Al Noor mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance.

He allegedly fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. The attack was live-streamed from a head-mounted camera.

Australian cult leader Anne Hamilton-Byrne has died in Melbourne at the age of 98.

Her cult, The Family, was accused of imprisoning and brainwashing children in the 1970s and 80s.

Hamilton-Byrne thought she was a reincarnation of Jesus Christ and blended drug-taking with mysticism and Christianity.

For most of the accusations against her, she never faced trial and suffered from dementia in her later years.

Originally a yoga teacher, she founded the cult in the late 1960s; it operated for more than 20 years, until police raided its property in the state of Victoria in 1987.

She and her husband Bill Byrne took children through adoptions, allowing the cult to assemble and imprison them in a strict home-schooling environment at a rural property near Eildon in Victoria.

Image caption The ""Hamilton-Byrne"" children at Lake Eildon in the 1980s

Allegedly administering drugs to the minors, the cult was also accused of subjecting them to beatings, starvation and brainwashing.

The children wore identical clothes and had their hair dyed blond; they were told that one day they would take over the world.

""Growing up, it was Anne and Bill, they were mum and dad; and then there were foster kids, and they were kids of other sect members, who would either come up on weekends or stay there for stints of a couple of years,"" Ben Shenton, a former Eildon child, told the BBC's Storyville programme.

""The greatest amount of kids at any given stage was 28,"" he added.

""We all had blonded bleached hair - not all of us, some had red hair, because Auntie Anne [Anne Hamilton-Byrne] was actually naturally red-headed,"" Roland Whitaker, who also spent time at Eildon as a child, told Storyville.

He describes what the children were made to wear.

""Very royal, Von Trapp [characters in The Sound of Music] sort of clothes, your velvets, your smart shoes; everything had to be polished and looking the same - and that was really to implant in us that we're all brothers and sisters.""

Police began investigating the cult in the late 1980s and broke up the group, freeing the children.

Hamilton-Byrne was only ever convicted of fraud, having to pay A$5,000 ($3,450; £2.700) in fines.

She died in a nursing home in Melbourne.

Former Victoria police detective Lex de Man, who investigated Hamilton-Byrne at the time, said he ""shed not one tear today"", according to the Australia's The Age.

""Today for me brings to an end the life of one of Victoria's most evil people,"" he said, adding he still regretted she never faced justice on more allegations."," ",14 June 2019,Australian cult: The Family leader Anne Hamilton-Byrne dies,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48632887

Thousands of Australians have honoured the nation's third-longest serving leader, Bob Hawke, in a state memorial service at the Sydney Opera House.

Mr Hawke was prime minister from 1983 to 1991 - a period of immense national reforms. He died last month aged 89.

He was honoured as an ""inspirational"" figure in a service attended by his family and many prominent Australians, including five former prime ministers.

Mr Hawke launched his successful bid for PM at the opera house in 1983.

He went on to win four elections - still a record for a Labor Party leader - and achieve record approval ratings. Together with successor Paul Keating, Mr Hawke is credited with modernising Australia's economy.

Among other legacies, he created Australia's universal Medicare healthcare system, promoted large-scale conservation efforts, and outlawed workplace gender discrimination.

His wife, Blanche d'Alpuget, said that his death had prompted ""a national outpouring of grief"".

""Today, this memorial service marks the transition from the grief of loss to the celebration of a life triumphantly well lived,"" she told the service.

In his tribute, Prime Minister Scott Morrison described Australia as ""a nation Bob Hawke loved and that deeply loved him in return"".

Thousands more watched the service on a screen outside, with some carrying tributes on placards.

Former prime minister Julia Gillard, who is chairing a summit overseas, said in a video message: ""A million words could be written and a million more spoken about Bob Hawke, such is the breadth of his achievement.

""But for me, the essence of the Bob I knew is caught by one word - inspiration... He inspired the nation to embrace a new and better future.""

Others celebrated Mr Hawke for his ""larrikin"" humour, resolve, and preparedness to show emotion.

Mr Hawke cried publicly a number of times in office - most famously in 1989 at a memorial service at Parliament House following the crackdown on Chinese students at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

It prompted him to offer asylum to Chinese students who were in Australia - a decision which ultimately granted permanent visas to 42,000 people.

Ms d'Alpuget used her speech to thank Chinese Australians for their condolences, saying ""in no country besides Australia did he have more friends... than in China"".

Mr Keating drew laughs when he told the service that he and Mr Hawke would sometimes ""criticise one another to immediate staff... often heavy criticisms"", but said the pair were united in delivering significant reforms.

US President Donald Trump has dismissed Iran's insistence it had no involvement with the attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.

Mr Trump cited footage that Washington says shows Iranian forces in a small boat taking an unexploded mine off the hull of one of the ships.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the truth needed to be ""clearly established"".

Russia has warned against drawing ""hasty conclusions"".

The blasts came a month after four oil tankers were damaged in an attack off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. The US blamed Iran for that attack, but did not produce evidence. Iran also denied those accusations.

Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated significantly since US President Donald Trump took office in 2017. He abandoned a nuclear deal that was brokered by the Obama administration and significantly tightened sanctions on Iran.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iranian TV footage shows a burning tanker

What did Trump say?

Speaking to Fox News, he said Iran ""did do it"".

""I guess one of the mines didn't explode and it's probably got essentially Iran written all over it. And you saw the boat at night trying to take the mine off and successfully took the mine off the boat, and that was exposed,"" he said.

He also said it was unlikely that Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz - a vital shipping lane through which a third of the world's seaborne oil passes every year - but if it did, the strait would not remain closed ""for long"".

Mr Trump's intervention came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to carry out the attacks and, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping showed Iran was behind it.

US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the US would be sharing intelligence to try to ""build international consensus to this international problem"".

How has Iran responded?

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Friday accused the US of posing ""a serious threat to stability in the Middle East"", without referring directly to the attacks in the Gulf of Oman.

He reiterated a call for international parties to the 2015 nuclear deal to honour their commitments, following a unilateral withdrawal by the Trump administration.

Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on Twitter accused the US of making an allegation ""without a shred of factual or circumstantial evidence"" and attempting to ""sabotage diplomacy"".

The footage released by the US on Thursday is rather more convincing than the circumstantial evidence it had provided earlier.

The small white patrol craft in the video is typical of the type used by Iran's IRGC (Revolutionary Guards) Navy in the Gulf. In recent years, the IRGC Navy has steadily supplanted Iran's conventional navy all along Iran's Gulf coast, from its border with Iraq in the north all the way down to Pakistan and the Arabian Sea. Its forces have built up a formidable flotilla of small, high-speed, hard-to-detect attack craft armed with mines, missiles, torpedoes and drones.

IRGC commandos regularly practise covert operations and simulated attacks. Some of their craft have come in close proximity to US Navy warships in the Gulf in recent years and there remains the risk of a clash at sea.

Iran has denied any involvement in Thursday's attacks, saying they were carried out by someone looking to derail Iran's relations with the international community. There will likely be doubts in Tehran as to whether this video is genuine.

What we know about the explosions

According to the US account of events, US naval forces in the region received distress calls from the Norwegian-owned Front Altair at 06:12 (02:12 GMT) and from the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous at 07:00, following explosions, and moved towards the area.

It said the USS Bainbridge observed Iranian naval boats operating in the area in the hours after the explosions, and later removing the unexploded mine from the side of the Kokuka Courageous.

The crews of both vessels were evacuated to other ships nearby. Both Iran and the US later released pictures showing rescued crew members on board their vessels.

BSM Ship Management, which manages the Kokuka Courageous, said the ship's crew abandoned ship after observing a fire and an unexploded mine.

However Yutaka Katada, the president of the ship's operator, Kokuka Sangyo, said members of the crew had reported ""that the ship was attacked by a flying object"".

The Kokuka Courageous was about 30km (20 miles) off the Iranian coast when it sent its emergency call.

The Front Altair was carrying naphtha, a petrol product, from the United Arab Emirates to Taiwan. The Kokuka Courageous was carrying methanol from Saudi Arabia to Singapore.

According to global satellite monitoring company Iceye, the damage to the Front Altair caused some oil spill in the waters around the ship.

Image copyright Iceye Image caption A radar satellite image shows suspected oil slicks in the water around the Front Altair

Oil prices jumped as much as 4% after Thursday's incident.

Why are US-Iran tensions so high?

In 2018, the US pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal reached in 2015 that was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities. The move was strongly criticised by a number of countries, including the closest allies of the US.

In May, President Trump tightened US sanctions on Iran - mainly targeting its oil sector. Iran then announced it would suspend some commitments under the nuclear deal.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter?

In recent months, the US has strengthened its forces in the Gulf - saying there was a danger of Iranian attacks. It sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the region.

In response, Iran accused the US of aggressive behaviour. Those tensions rose markedly after the 12 May limpet mine attacks in the UAE.

The UAE blamed an unnamed ""state actor"". The US said that actor was Iran, an accusation Tehran denied.

While it is unclear why Iran would carry out a relatively low-level attack on the multinational tankers, observers have speculated that it could have been to send a signal to forces ranged against it that it is capable of disrupting shipping there without triggering a war."," ",14 June 2019,Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: Trump dismisses Iran denials,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48643313

Under new laws introduced on Saturday, Venezuelans need to have a passport and visa to enter Peru.

Authorities say about 6,000 Venezuelans crossed from neighbouring Ecuador alone on Thursday, three times the daily average.

Some four million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, according to the United Nations.

The country's imploding economy has resulted in high unemployment and shortages of food and medicine, and hundreds of thousands of people are said to be in need of humanitarian aid.

Previously, Venezuelan citizens wanting to enter Peru only required a national ID card.

""Our country has opened its arms to more than 800,000 Venezuelans,"" he told reporters at an event in the northern city of Piura. ""I think it's completely logical and justified to ask them to bring visas to ensure better control of who enters.""
